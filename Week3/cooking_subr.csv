Sorry to bother you all. It seems like everybody has years and years and years left, right up until they don't.
Edit
It turns out that at the end of the road, the things that really mattered were good times with friends and family, And these were almost all in the kitchen.
I've gotten to be relatively old, and finding out what I have certainly was not a happy thing, but given the number of my friends over the years that died with no notice from a heart attack or vehicle accident or whatever, this weirdly seems like a bit of a gift that I know what's coming and have
some
idea of a timeline. Although not a really good idea.
Go home make yummy food and have your friends and family over. Actual happy memories are all that matters, money, power, status, everything else is mostly all nonsense.
Edit
This outpouring support and sympathy is more than I could ever have imagined! Thank you all I really appreciate it; However in the
immortal words of Monty Python ""I'm not dead yet""
8-)
Right now I only have major annoyances but no show stoppers.
I plan to continue enjoying family and friends and cooking as much as I can, it's just harder and slower now because the surgery kind of wrecked my left side. On the other hand[terrible pun intended] I'm right handed,  so I can still do a lot of stuff, it just takes longer.
PS if any of you are cooking for anybody that has cancer and has no appetite, I can tell you from first-hand experience that
the banana bread
goes down really easily and sits really well.
The weird part about all this was that I initially found it and made it for someone else who had cancer about 25 years ago, And now we make it for me.
I also can't express enough gratitude that due to the efforts of friends I've never met all over the world the things that made me happy during my life will continue to make others happy for decades or maybe even hundreds of years in the future. The internet which is the very definition of ""not permanent stuff"" is now the eternal keeper of the things in life which mean the most to me which were food and friends and family.
Please note that I have read and appreciate each and every one of your replies. I have not answered them all because doing things online while missing large chunks of my brain is quite a bit more difficult than it used to be. But know that I read them all and you're all appreciated and I thank you all.

WE HAVE RECIPES.
Yesterday's post
Okay, so, I very quickly realised from comments and PMs that there are A LOT of people here on tight budgets who struggle to eat well due to depression. And a lot of self-help advice requires more energy and motivation than people with depression actually have.
So, I actually went and did it. I've made a blog dedicated to NOT cooking. It's called
""Fuck It, I'm Not Cooking""
.
Nothing I ever post will take more than five minutes to make, nor require any more preparation than chopping things and wrapping a tortilla. All of it's cheap and healthy, or healthy as long as you don't overdo the condiments. I've made a ""master shopping list"" so you only have to shop once a week, don't waste much food, and should be able to carry it all home if you don't have a car. Everything's inexpensive and easy to find in the supermarket. There'll be both sweet and savoury recipes, snacks, and healthy alternatives to cravings for crappy food.
Basically, it's supposed to be as much/less effort than your usual depression eating, taste good, and be way better for you.
I've spent all day setting it up, from tomorrow there will be recipes daily. So far, I've posted a few super basic recipes in with the Master Shopping List.
Here's the main page:

Here's some commentary on how and why I made it
Here's the Master Shopping List, with bonus ""Master"" recipes

I’m a student, so I don’t have the budget to go above and beyond what I already spend (eg. like on eggs bought direct from farmer because they’re over double the price of the ones I get now). 
It’s sad that it’s a luxury to buy from the source, but please don’t push people to buy more expensive things when they say they dont have the budget, yes we know theyll taste better but that just makes it harder when we have to go back to the cheaper versions haha
TL;DR not everyone has the ability to purchase the more expensive options for ingredients, don’t guilt them about it

Cooking,https://old.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/i3diwb/for_the_love_of_god_please_stop_bashing_american/,17886,1628,"For the love of god, please stop bashing American Chinese food as ""fake"" or ""inauthentic"" [Rant]","As a second gen Chinese American myself, I am really tired of people being a complete snob over authenticity to the point that they distort the history and culture behind Chinese cuisine.
I've had enough of people trashing American Chinese food as ""not the real thing"" or even worse, ""Chinese food dumbed down for American people"" (like WTF?!)
While I don't deny that Chinese food in America is different from Chinese food on the mainland, that  doesn't make it any less worthy. Sure, it has been changed to some extent to suit local palates, but that's pretty much the same thing with Chinese food in the diaspora in general. There is also Indonesian Chinese, Filipino Chinese, Singaporean Chinese, and even Peruvian Chinese  food-yet nobody calls these variants as ""fake"" or ""inauthentic"".
Moreover, people had to make adaptations to the cuisine anyways in the new land due to the lack of available ingredients that they usually had back home.  No Chinese broccoli? Use western broccoli instead.
One has to remember that Chinese cuisine is by no means a monolith- it's pretty diverse with a lot of regional variations-hence Beijing cuisine is different from Shanghai cuisine and Cantonese cuisine. A lot of early Chinese immigrants to the US were from the Guangdong province, hence American Chinese food is heavily based on the cuisine from that area (albeit still a limited representation).  This is the reason why later immigrants from other parts of China might find American Chinese cuisine to be strange and completely foreign.
I always have to chuckle whenever someone tries hard to demonstrate what ""authentic"" and ""inauthentic"" Chinese food is by comparing a Chinese takeout dish with Cantonese origins (ie, chow mein or orange chicken) to a dish from another region in China, which is essentially comparing apples to oranges. A good example would be this
Buzzfeed video
in which the host claims to try ""authentic"" sweet and sour pork for the first time, when in reality the version that she tried is no less ""authentic"" than the one she is used to. Only difference is that the so-called ""authentic"" version is another regional variation, just like the Cantonese-style sweet and sour pork many are familiar with.
While I do appreciate people willing to take a deeper look into Chinese cuisine beyond the menu at the local takeout, there's no need to be an utter snob about it. Food is food, peeps. It's high time that we recognize American Chinese cuisine as something unique of its own.
EDIT: Holy smokes this thread did blow up unexpectedly. I'm seeing a lot of amazing input from various perspectives. Here are a few additional things I want to add
1) While I did mention American Chinese food in the post and title, I was also referring to Chinese food in the western diaspora in general (including Canadian Chinese food, British Chinese food, etc.)
2) Regarding authenticity, yes it is something that does exist, though at the same time it is something that is very subjective. Given the insanely diverse array of Chinese cuisine, it would be disingenuous to pinpoint ""authenticity"" as solely one way of cooking. There's no such thing as ""this is the only way to do it right"". Take Kung Pao chicken for example. While the original version in Sichuan is hot and spicy, there are also other regional versions in China that are less spicy.
3) Some of y'all also talked about how some people bash American/Western Chinese food out of an identity crisis- this especially rings true for a lot of second gen Chinese Americans grappling between two cultures. On one hand, American Chinese food has been looked down on for a very long time due to the perception that it is greasy, sketchy, unhealthy, etc. A lot of second gen Chinese Americans might feel ashamed to be associated with this kind of food, so they overcompensate by going on full board with the authenticity train- trying hard to prove that Chinese food is more than just the takeout menu. A much as I detest the culinary gatekeeping sentiment, I can definitely see where it's coming from.
4) I also find it interesting how a lot of people think of American Chinese food as generally heavy on the grease, starch and sugar. While I do get it's kinda explainable given that general tso's chicken, sesame chicken, and orange chicken are some of the most popular American Chinese dishes, there's also way more to that as well. Heck, even American Chinese cuisine can be vast and diverse! Of course there's also a lot of less greasy, less sugary foods like moo goo gai pan and moo shoo pork. However in my state, Louisiana, there's also yakmein and crawfish fried rice. Let's bring on the goodness!",

I made an Italian wedding soup.  Usually I sub in a can of Cannellini beans.  It’s quick, it’s simple, it’s tasty, the internet told me to.
But my wife bought special beans.  What makes these beans special?  Probably the fucking marketing, but they were on the shelf, dried, in a small plastic bag touting the wonderful properties of beans.  She bought them at a bean store in San Francisco.  Only in SF could there be a fucking bean store during a pandemic.  Great fanfare was made over this package of beans.
We soaked them for like an hour, tossed them in when we’d normally toss in the can of beans.  Cooked another 15 minutes, and served.  They were… crunchy, but the broth flavor was really good, so we figured “meh, eat this bowl, let it keep cooking.”  Kinda like slightly undercooked rice, you know?
I did not know.
My wife’s sister went first.  There was unexplained running during a movie.
My wife went second.  Two down.
I’m now sitting on the couch by myself with the pets listening to my brother in law make pterodactyl noises with distant cough/vomit sounds in the background from my wife and sister-in-law like a gross harmony.
We’re out of toilets to puke in.  I’m feeling about a 7/10.  I have yet to determine if time is a friend or an enemy for me tonight.
Turns out, dried beans need to be soaked for 5 hours, then boiled, and always eaten very tender.
Thank you for this final lesson 2021.  “Purging the past” jokes are being received poorly by all those involved.
Anyways, it’s 9:30 here.  Happy new year.  Here’s to fucking 2022.",

What's going on?
A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app
permanently inaccessible
to users.
On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from
Apollo
to
Reddit is Fun
to
Narwhal
to
BaconReader
.
Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface
.
This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.
What's the plan?
On June 12th,
many subreddits
will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away
permanently
unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because
we love Reddit
, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.
The two-day blackout isn't the
goal
, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.
What can
you
do?
Complain.

The label on the quarter wheel was clearly incorrect, saying that it was .42 pounds, and so was only $10.92. When I went over to the register to see if they would let me actually purchase it, it rung up as it showed on the label, and the cashier let me buy it! When I got home, it weighed 23 pounds! At $25.99/pound, that's $600 of cheese for only $11! I'm planning on giving a lot of it away to friends and family. I've cut it into ~1 lb chunks, vacuum sealed them, and split them between the fridge and freezer. What recipes should I make with my haul???
TLDR: Got an incredible deal on 23 lbs of parmesan cheese for only $11. What should I make?
Edit: photos
https://imgur.com/a/23-lb-cheese-AEZcewy
Edit 2: To be clear, during the check out process the cashier was very aware that this was an absurd price for this large wheel of cheese, and had no qualms about ringing it up as it is. Also, if you look at the website for Murray's Cheese, you will notice that they are absolutely not a Mom & Pop shop, but have hundreds of locations across the USA.
Edit 3: To add some context, I actually arrived at the register without the cheese, and when the cashier asked ""anything else?"" I made a joke about ""not unless you'll actually sell me that quarter wheel of cheese for $11!"" She said ""bring it over!"" so I did, and when it rang up as $11 dollars and I was in shock, she made multiple jokes about it being 11 million dollars. As multiple people have stated in the comments, NY has a law that requires stores to sell their merchandise at the labeled price.

Ketchup.  One day I'll be bored enough to decide to try to make my own ketchup, but right now nothing equals Heinz.
Garlic.  I don't use garlic powder, but I do buy the peeled stuff and refrigerate it.  Futzing around with whole heads of garlic and the papery skin is just a little annoying.
McDonald's.  I don't eat fast food very often, but I do like a good quarter pounder with cheese now and then, supersize the Coke and fries and to hell with the pearl-clutchers.
Breakfast cereal.  Sure, sometimes the hippy-dippy Seven Whole Grain Colon Blow Quinoa Explosion stuff is fine if you add some fruit, but I'm Generation X; gimme a couple bowls of Captain Crunch Oops All-Berries.
Hot dogs. I don't make a steady diet of them, but gimme a simple hot dog in a bun with chili from a can, diced onions, and yellow mustard.  Awesome.  Gimme three, actually.
Milk.  I have no curiosity about raw milk, I don't need your authentic, hand-strained, teat-to-table beef milk.  I just drink whole milk.  I never, however, drink skim milk.  Which is water, that's lying about being milk.

To me, they've always been rather plain, but that seemingly was never a problem before. Something has changed, though I'm not sure what.
I'm using 80/20 ground beef, fresh as can be, from a decent grocery store in Massachusetts (Shaw's). My wife likes hers still mooing, but the boys want theirs perma-charred - no pink allowed.
Current recipe (use at your own risk): 7 oz of beef, manhandled into submission, flattened, and sacrificed to a medium-high skillet for 4 minutes per side. Cheese gets a 60-second cameo at the end. Brioche buns because I really do try to make my fam happy.
I've never had to season ground beef before, but maybe that's where I've gone wrong? Is there a secret burger society I'm not privy to? A bovine illuminati?

It was just a late night rant. After sleeping on it and rereading it this morning I do realise I could have possibly used a slightly better tone here. I stand by what I said 100% but I could have possibly done it without insulting people. Apologies if I have upset anyone.
I'm going to point out at the start here that I think and hope that I am not talking to the majority of the members of this sub if you do nothing else just read the links provided, you don't have to read my rant
I posted an off the cuff comment in here recently replying to someone in the UK who was asking what they should buy at a Chinese supermarket. I said MSG crystals because they genuinely are essential in Chinese cooking. I got downvoted for it which doesn't bother me apart from the fact that this is a cooking sub and debunked racist conspiracy theories shouldn't really have a place here.
It genuinely did start with a hoax, it s complete bullshit. I am going to hope (probably in vain) that the idiots will read the links as I'm not going to do their homework for them but I know they won't.
I'm writing this for the idiots, so I'm discounting the fact that most of you vaguely intelligent people realise that glutamates are naturally present in a hell of a lot of food (apologies again for the rant), let's just imagine for a minute that tomatoes, cheese, mushrooms and meat don't contain glutamates. I mean they do and all you sufferers eat this stuff all the time but the minute it's a little Chinese tasting you have a reaction.
It's a genuinely ingrained racist reaction and you should as members of cooking sub that celebrates cuisine from all over the world be disgusted with yourselves (talking to the idiots again).
MSG is a fantastic additive that everybody should have in their kitchen, it is no different from adding a pinch of salt to your cooking, not just Chinese food, it adds a depth to tomato sauces, cheese sauces, fried chicken. It truly is fantastic stuff.
Anyway, as I said, apologies for the rant, I'm sure most of you understand the benefits of it, this is just for the small coterie of idiots that still cling to this ridiculous theory.

My wife's friend came to stay the weekend and being as she's vegan she cooked for us. The food was really good.
I wanted to learn more and bought some Beyond Meat patties they were surprisingly similar to texture to a well done burger. I tried Beyond Meat at a fast food place and it tasted like an overseasoned paste that left regret on my tongue for the rest of the day.
Vegetarian foods in America try to replace meat. MorningStar is never going to replace a prime rib with black beans. But it won't stop them from trying.
This is in direct contrast with asian foods (the other half of my heritage). Where vegetable dishes seem integrated into cultural norms. Hinduism and Indian food for instance. Or Thai foods, Chinese foods have vegetables take up the entire dish. These foods also are heavily influenced by auxiliary tastes. Instead of the beef talking, its aromatic spices and insanely hot peppers.
I'm making sweeping generalizations. But I wonder if it's possible to create foods that are not simply lesser imitations of what you really want (fake chicken nuggies) but a mainstay dish. And if it is possible to make it simple enough for an American pallette and accessible to cooks who don't have much time. Maybe there are and I don't know about them.
TL;DR Is it possible to create true vegetable focused dishes in the USA that arent trying to replace meat as the star of any given meal.
Edit: Thank you for your thoughtful replies and rewards. I'll try to get to your comments!
Edit 2: I want to say I do not think that vegetarians are trying to substitute meat for everything. My vegan guest certainly didn't do that and didn't throw tofu in everything to attempt to cover for meat.

Like, «you stole our spices and now you butcher our food». But I think people are judging him on the wrong premise. I don’t think making authentic dishes has ever been his point. Most people in the UK are very normal working class people with poor diets. Whose worlds are their local communities, and they do what they can to get by. And these normal, busy people are Oliver’s target group. He’s a champion when it comes to public health, and his goal is to get the public to make their own food and eat healthier. For them, chilli jam and soy sauce is probably exotic enough. So adding soy sauce to a dish makes it «Asian». Because that’s how it is to the people he’s speaking to. Had he gone full authentic, it wouldn’t have served the purpose at all, as nobody would have bothered. His shows aren’t meant for British Asians with a strong knowledge of the cuisine of their country of origin. And I don’t see how that’s offensive or wrong.
I’m a massive foodie, and I would never go to Jamie if I wanted to learn how to make for example pad thai. Cause his recipes aren’t meant for that, they’re not meant for foodies who want to spend an entire Saturday making the perfect dandan noodles

First,, freezing fresh ginger and grating it frozen.

Second, adding a splash of soy sauce to chocolate desserts. I know it sounds absolutely insane, but a teaspoon in brownies or chocolate cake batter doesn't make them taste Asian at all, it just makes the chocolate flavor deeper and more complex. Something about the umami. My friends have been trying to figure out my ""secret ingredient"" for years.
Lastly, using a hair dryer on chicken skin before roasting. Sounds ridiculous but it completely dries the skin so it gets shatteringly crisp in the oven. I have a cheap one I keep just for cooking.

I followed it exactly, down to the instruction that said not to add salt until the chicken fat began to rise and impurities could be skimmed off.

When I served it, my mom didn’t know I had followed that specific recipe. But as soon as she smelled it, she froze. She looked at me, confused, then smiled softly. I watched as her eyes welled up with tears. She didn’t even need to say anything, I knew that smell had brought her back.

Every time I watched a cooking video where the cook added lemon juice to a hearty soup or a pasta sauce, I cringed. “That can’t be good…” I thought.
I was a fool.
Today, I was making a Turkish-inspired lentil soup, one of my favourites. Well, I accidentally burned the onions and garlic. Only slightly — not too much — but definitely just enough to be noticeable.
The cheapskate that I am, instead of tossing it and starting over as I should have, I rolled with it... which turned out to be a big mistake. The bitterness was definitely there.
Panicked, I looked online, and learned that apparently, lemon juice
can
offset some of such bitterness. Desperate, I added just about a tablespoon of freshly squeezed lemon juice, and simmered it on low for a bit longer than I usually would.
It worked.
When I tasted it once it was finished, I couldn’t believe it. The bitterness was gone. My husband, unaware of the situation, happily ate it without noticing anything unusual. I even asked afterwards, and he insisted it tasted just as it usually does.
So, lemon juice… I’m sorry. I now respect you in hearty recipes, not just in fresh ones or in tea. I will definitely never doubt your addition again.",

A proposed new rule would allow poultry plants to process diseased chickens. That’s the last thing Americans need.,"Consider the decision last month by the agriculture department’s Food Safety and Inspection Service to allow poultry plants to process diseased chickens for human consumption.
In July the FSIS approved a petition from the National Chicken Council requesting that slaughterhouses be allowed to process broilers infected with Avian Leukosis — a virus that causes chickens to develop cancerous lesions and tumors. Inspectors would no longer be required to examine the first 300 birds of each flock for signs of the disease, and processors would be able to cut off tumors and lesions and then process the rest of the bird. The approval has led to a proposed rule change that is now before the food safety administrator Paul Kiecker.
Here’s what we know about Avian Leukosis: A small percentage of birds (less than 1%) are diagnosed with the virus each year, but it spreads quickly through flocks and tens of thousands of chickens are condemned annually due to exposure. While it’s unlikely that the virus could transfer from chickens to humans, it’s not impossible. There is some evidence that workers exposed to birds infected with the disease in the U.K. have developed antibodies, indicating a transfer of the virus from animal to human.

And even then, if all you can afford are dollar store spices, that's ok, it still works, and really, it doesn't make thaaaat much of a difference. Add some acid and salt and you're good to go.
Edit: the snobbery of saying only food using fresh ground spices is good is what I'm taking issue with. Not everyone can afford a blender or coffee grinder, or even have the space for it.  Cooking should be accessible to Every One. And they shouldn't be shamed for not being able to.

What is a ""1 medium onion"" (my grocery store literally only carries 'jumbo' yellow onions unless I buy a 5 lb bag)?
When a recipe calls for ""1/2 cup fresh sage leaves, finely chopped"" does it want packed leaves or lose leaves? In general, due to the order I assume this means ""Get 1/2 cup fresh sage leaves then chop them"" but there is a big difference between ""1/2 packed cups"" and ""1/2 loose cups"".
I know not everyone has a scale (especially a sensitive scale) but why can't we just say ""1 medium onion (about 1 cup or 100 grams)""( no idea if that is a good conversion or not just using a example).
For the most part, it probably doesn't matter but sometimes I really would like to have a weight so I can just tare the scale and start adding the next thing.

I'm mostly talking about in ""professional"" recipes (i.e. ones that people are paid to write). If you post something on reddit/your blog I don't really mind (and I don't mind overall to be honest it's mostly an annoyance).
I'm not advocating dropping volumes. I'm just advocating adding weights as well. MANY recipes already do this in reverse (i.e. 4 ounces parmesan, grated (About 2 cups)) so if something is not well suited for volume it would be nice to have weight as well.",

They won’t buy the Alsa batter mix because of the palm oil in it, and I shouldn’t either tbh.. I’ll keep you updated in the cooking sub 👩‍🍳
I’ve really dug myself into a hole. It all started at this event where we were supposed to bring a cake. I had totally forgotten, didn’t have time, so I grabbed one of those ready made cake mixes, like Alsa (maybe its a French brand idk ). Of course, I didn’t dare admit it was just a box mix(edit not a box mix, but a already made batter) , since the whole idea was to bring something “homemade”… But then the cake was such a hit. Like, such a hit that ever since, people keep asking me to make my “famous” chocolate cake for every birthday, every party… 
This has been going on for years now. Everyone keeps begging me for the recipe, and I’ve tried a million times to recreate it with recipes I find online, but the result is always so disappointing compared to that cursed mix. And now my friends are getting annoyed at me for not sharing the recipe, cause I keep saying I will.
So please, I need help figuring out how to reproduce this chocolate cake. On top of everything, the mix is ridiculously expensive, and I’m tired of wasting money and lying to my friends!

Ingredients: Palm oil, EGG 21%, sugar, cocoa powder 18% (sugar, cocoa mass, cocoa and low-fat cocoa powder, natural vanilla flavor), WHEAT flour 10.3%, a stabilizer (glycerol), powdered CREAM, powdered EGG white, a pinch of raising agents (diphosphates and sodium carbonates), a little salt, and a preservative (E202).

I had some hot sauce in the fridge given to me as a gift. I cooked some poached eggs for breakfast and decided to add this rather than my normal salt/pepper.
I'm now a shadow of my former self. The sauce added so much flavour and depth to what I already thought was a delicious breakfast... it blew my mind...
It is now IMPOSSIBLE to enjoy food without some kind of spice. I genuinely feel unsatisfied if food doesn't have some kind of kick. The average restaurant experience is now ruined. Bland food genuinely upsets me now and I look down upon people who have not been 'awakened' to the point that I have had arguments.
I talk about hot sauce in my sleep. I fight strangers in the street.
Last night, making love to my wife, in the moment of climax instead of screaming her name I screamed out  'HOT SAAAUUUCE'. She is now leaving me after I said her porridge was bland.
I have lost control and it's all the Hot Sauce's fault.

It turns out she bought a tool on Amazon, thinking that would work, obviously she doesn’t know how to use a rolling pin either. The skin was so thick, also sadly not holding the fillings inside.

The book sets out not to be a list of recipes to make, but to teach you how to cook with what you've got. And it succeeds.
Basically, it teaches you how to cook, not just how to make things.

For those of you wondering about if you should buy the book after watching the show, here's my suggestion.
If you liked the show, buy the book. Regardless of what you liked about the show, you will find more of it in the book and will enjoy it.
If you didn't like the show because it didn't teach you much, buy the book anyway because the book teaches what you were expecting the show to.

EDIT: Okay, “proper” might not be the word to use with the scrambled eggs in general. The proper European/French way is a better way of saying it as it’s abundantly clear American scrambled eggs are vastly different and closer to what I’d described",

It was so much worse-- it tasted off and no improvement in crispiness.  I saw so many chefs (looking at you, Bon Appetit) doing it and swearing by it that I was convinced I might have messed it up the first time and should try again.  Nope, same result!
This is a classic ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"".  A grilled cheese was always perfect-- there is no hack or improvement to this platonic ideal of crispy, buttery bread breaking through to the warm lava flow of melty cheese.  The butter is an essential element, giving the nuttiness of it browning in the skillet and perfect texture.  Go ahead and riff on it with all the combinations and additions all you like, making delicious melts of all varieties, but don't change the core elements: bread, cheese, and BUTTER.  Sometimes we need to realize ""oh right, it's been done this way forever because we figured out it's perfect like this"" (this applies to a lot of kitchen gadgets too, when the basic tools + basic practice and understanding are so much better).",

I was so excited about all the lovely things I was going to do with it, 4 hours on the stove. Honestly one of the best stocks I have ever made. I had recently read a thread on here about kitchen mistakes and people were saying the worst is when you forget to place a pan under the strainer, and accidentally poured their stock down the drain. So, obviously I was hyper vigilant about it. Strained my stock and set it in the pan to one side to cool. Next time I go into the kitchen the pot is empty. How thoughtful, he must have put it in the fridge. No, he poured it down the drain claiming he thought it was dirty dish water, like a pot left to soak. I am shocked and disappointed and confused as to how anyone could mistake an aromatic stock for soapy dish water.

Like seriously - no more wondering if you tapped your cup of flour enough. No more having to wash all your measuring cups and spoons. No more having to worry about the density of your ingredients:
“is one cup of finely shredded parmesan more than one cup of coarsely shredded parmesan?”
You put all your ingredients in one bowl and you reset the scale each time you need to measure a new ingredient. That’s it. Easy peasy.
