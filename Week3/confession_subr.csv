So I got his $40K pool filled in.,"I live with my mom. She’s quiet, keeps to herself, never bothers anyone. A few months ago, our new neighbor decided to report her to the city for having an “illegal shed” in the backyard.
It was total BS, the shed’s been there for years and has full permits. An inspector came out, checked everything, and left without saying a word.
But the neighbor? Smug. Proud. Thought he’d scared us.
So I did a little digging.
Turns out his brand-new pool was way too close to the property line and illegally built over a utility easement.
I reported him. Attached photos. Quoted city codes.
Two weeks later, the city ordered him to either move it (impossible) or fill it in. He lost the whole thing $40,000 down the drain. Literally.
Now he gets to look at our completely legal shed every day… while standing over a pile of dirt where his pool used to be.

Probably got weeks, maybe couple months at best. I am 22, don’t own a house, don’t own my car. Have maybe £2k in the bank. 
So I took out a credit card, 6.5k limit, 0% APR for 20 months. (I was previously building up a good credit score) and am now buying whatever the fuck I want. The debt will die with me, and I give no fucks.
And if you want to beef me about driving your bank fees up with this behaviour, at least you get to live. lol
EDIT:: Thank you all for your amazing responses. Unfortunately it’s bone cancer that has spread through my whole body, so I’m too weak now to travel far, as much as I would have wanted to see the world.
I’m going to go bigger, and do some good stuff, if you have ideas. I want to do some big donations to food banks and cancer charities that supported me through my journey and make some differences before I pop.
Alsos shame on you all of you asking me for money.
UPDATE 2:
Took out some more cards, thanks for the suggestions
Some of you asking, I’m a girl haha
I’ve bought lots of things for my family, mostly sentimental things with my handwriting on.
I bought a crab at a fancy ass seafood place. That was awesome
I’ve donated to animal shelters and food banks. Also to the cancer charities who helped drag my ass through this.
Also can y’all stop telling me to find Jesus, I respect those of you who are praying for me, because I know that’s your way of thinking of me and I’m really touched by that.
But finding god is in no way in my plans and not what I believe will happen after death, trying to force religion down a dying persons throat is really not the vibe.
Update 3:
Still hanging on, I’ve deteriorated quite a lot now, lost a lot of functionality in my body at this point so I’m bedbound and mostly just watching lots of TV and seeing family. But I’m comfortable, eating apples and cheese and lots of little treats. Thank you all for still checking in and thinking of me.
I’m really fortunate to be surrounded by my friends and family right now, when you boil it all down to it in the end, it really is all you need.
Anyway I’ll try update again soon. ✌️",

And it’s not because I didn’t want to attend that concert, I really wanted that, but not even one of my friend agreed, it’s not about the concert only, I am a person who lives alone and my family lives in a different town, I see people on their birthday getting tagged in shit ton of stories or post, but no one ever tags me, i didn’t even got a call from my family I had a friend who used to call it at exactly 12 but today I didn’t even get that call, I asked my office colleagues to celebrate my birthday with me and I will sponsor liquor’s and cakes and everything yet they said they had plan for weekends, i hope I am not a terrible person, I think I am but I always wished people on time, I never purposefully hurt anyone but if I did I am sorry, I never did that though, I think they did not like how I look maybe, I have vitiligo and I am not that successful for my age, because I am little under confident, is that why people hate me, I don’t know why people hate me cause if I am unsuccessful I can be successful but that’s not it, maybe they hate that I have vitiligo, maybe that’s the reason, but I didn’t ask for it, I just got it, but can people just hate me just because I have vitiligo, I think so, I wouldn’t hate anyone though, I love all kind of people even the one who literally beaten the shit out of me when I was school because I got offended cause they were making jokes on my skin condition, maybe I shouldn’t got offended at that time, and they were only having fun I could have ignored them or maybe laughed with them, that might have resulted in a good friendship maybe, they might have wished me, I think I was always the problem, that’s why not even my parents loves me as they love my brother, he’s successful, he’s abroad with his wife and a dog, they are amazing, they didn’t wish me though it’s okay it’s still not over his office hours he is 6 hrs behind so he might have forgotten and it’s Okay, he’s busy, but he was the only one who understood me, but then when he got married and he got busy and it’s understandable, hope he becomes more successful, even last year he forgot my birthday, because he had this big project he was working, my friend that always called me he didn’t call though, he said he was travelling, might be that, I think people forget me cause I am not that important, and that’s fine I don’t add anything but only takes, I think I am Terrible for not adding value in life of people maybe after that only people will call me on my birthday, but I think it’s too late now cause I think if I leave now, no one would be that hurt as they already created distance from me, and they won’t feel sad, i am a terrible person and maybe that’s why my ex called got married to someone else, she took a right decision who wants a person who will always be vulnerable infront of them, although I was strong when she told me that she’s getting married in 3 weeks, and her roka is day after tomorrow, I didn’t shed a single tear and didn’t uttered an emotional word, I just left saying congratulations enjoy your life, she might thought I am heartless, well I was heartbroken not heartless but I can understand her POV, I think you can understand why I am a terrible person, and isn’t it better to sleep forever not knowing what happened to you
Edit: I don’t know what to write now?
Just that there are literally close to 2k people that actually wanted to be my friend and wished me, I was crying last night that not even single person called or messaged and I woke up with so many wishes, my phone is heating because of all the notifications I have been getting
I woke up  and it’s 7:25 am exactly 7 hours when I started writing that post, and I think this could have been the best thing I can ask for!
I saw few comments that people want to come and attend concert with me and I would definitely love that
Everyone thank you so much in understanding, I will go through each comment and will try to reply all 200+ of you in my dm

So I bought a 12-pack of LaCroix because, you know, that’s what the cool, healthy people were drinking. First sip? It tasted like someone whispered the word “fruit” into a cup of TV static. Absolutely disgusting. But I had already posted it on my Instagram story with the caption: “New addiction lol.”
And that was the beginning of my downfall.
Friends started bringing LaCroix over when they visited. Coworkers stocked it in the office fridge “because I liked it.” My girlfriend (now fiancée) thought it was cute how “into sparkling water” I was, so she bought me a SodaStream for Christmas.
Now I’m in too deep. I’ve become the guy who nods thoughtfully while drinking what is essentially spicy sadness. I have flavors in my fridge with names like “Pamplemousse” and “Limoncello,” and I pretend like I can tell the difference. I can’t. It all tastes like carbonated regret.
Sometimes I just want a normal drink. But if I ever open a Gatorade, someone will say, “Whoa, no LaCroix today?” and I’ll just fake laugh like, “Haha, gotta switch it up!” Meanwhile my soul is quietly screaming.
Anyway, if you’re young and reading this: never lie about your beverages. That stuff will haunt you.

confession,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/c11din/im_putting_my_extremely_profoundly_disabled_7/,66691,2789,I'm putting my extremely profoundly disabled 7 year old into a residential facility so I can forget he exists. I'm not sorry.,"I can't tell anyone this, even my therapist. Lambast me if you wanr and maybe I even deserve it. I only ask what you would do if you were in my situation. Not what you think ""people should"" do. What you would REALLY do.
I'm a single mom of 2 boys. 12 and 7. My husband passed away 3 years ago in a work accident. A very large portion of me believe it was a suicide. I can't see him EVER making the mistake he made that caused his death, and he had taken an action just before that which ensured his co-workers weren't in the room. I fully believe he killed himself because of our younger son and no one will ever change my mind.
We were told when I was pregnant that he would have Downs Syndrome. We could handle that. Even if it was severe. It turned out he has a chromosome deletion. His disorder is kind of rare so I won't post which specific one but suffice to say he'll never be anything more than he is now or has ever been.
And what he is, is nothing.
He doesn't appear to have any awareness and never has. His eyes are locked in one position, he doesn't respond to noise, touch, or pain. He is total care. He is capable of nothing. He is tube fed and on oxygen. He is in diapers and will be forever. He makes no sounds, no attempts to communicate. He never even really cried as a baby.
He has never made an attempt to interact with anyone or his environment.
I'm not upset because I got a special needs/""imperfect"" child. I feel the way I feel because this...... thing..... takes up 200% of my time and does NOTHING. I didn't get an imperfect child. I didn't get
a child
.
I don't love him. He doesn't have any personality, there is nothing to love. And yet I'm responsible for him. In addition to his extreme delays he's also medically fragile. Respiratory crises, fecal impactions (his autonomic nervous system doesn't function properly), issues with his G tube, infections, pressure sores no matter WHAT we put him on or how we position him.
Our older son has suffered because his non existent brother has colored everything in his life. He's had medical care get delayed because there's only one of me and hos brother is more critical. We do have a visiting home nurse but only 20 hrs/week and we aren't eligible for more. I was starting law school, I gave up my dreams and my plan for my children for this potato. My older son can't do a lot of things he wants to do because of the youngers need for care and appointments.
The final straw was I heard a sound. I went into Younger Son's room to check, thinking he had forgotten how to breathe again, and saw Older Son hitting him and screaming ""You're why I don't have a mother! You're why I don't have a father! You're why I can't have friends over! You're why I can't be in sports! I didn't ask for you and I hope you die!""
Instead of being horrified, I watched. And Younger Son just did. not. react. No signs of pain or fear or upset. No reaction at all.
He breathes but he is not alive. He doesn't know who I am. He doesn't know who Older Son is. He has no sense of self, life experience, or awareness of his surroundings.
He doesn't need to be in my home. He doesn't know or care where he is. He is genetically my son but he is not family. My previously abused, brain damaged cat who can't walk straight has more personality and is far more loveable than my ""child"". In fact I was looking FORWARD to raising a Downs baby. Even one with severe impairments, for that reason. With disability can come gifts. This boy is not a gift. He is a genetic mistake I probably should have miscarried and would have definitely terminated if I'd known he would be like this. And the flip side is, if he HAS awareness..... he's miserable. And there is nothing I can do. If he has likes and dislikes no one knows what they are. If he is in pain he can't tell anyone. If he wants anything, he can't communicate. He's had every imaginable therapy, nothing has made a difference.
And so he's leaving our home on the 29th. I feel excited and relieved and then guilty because I know we'll be happier with him gone.
He's already taken my husband and my son's father. He was working so so so much OT to pay for the cucumber's care. For the experimental therapies insurance wouldn't cover. Because THIS one was going to be the BREAKTHROUGH. He was tired and defeated and disappointed. He sought counseling as well but I don't think he could ever say the words ""I don't want my son in my home"" either.
He's ruined my older son. I was so wrapped up on the younger I never realized how ignored and damaged he was. He lost his father too. I didn't just lose my husband. HE is my priority now and this malignant lump can be someone else's problem. At least they'll be paid a wage to care for him. At least they'll get a break from him when they punch out.
I just want to never think of him again and I'm not sorry. And for that, I'm sorry.
Thanks for reading.

, for calling me a liar. Are you a medical doctor? If your Google Fu was any good you would have stumbled on 3p mosaic deletion-duplication syndrome. That is the disorder my son has. I've basically identified myself by posting that but hey, it's better than the PMs telling me to kill myself. If you look at the features of 3p deletion syndromes
they look like Downs
. My insurance didn't cover AFP testing which would have told us it WASN'T Downs and I didn't think we needed it. I had a regular ultrasound and a 3D. Both Drs were ""99% sure it was Downs"".
This post was absolutely NOT fiction. Instead the mods and especially
/u/piconeeks
just ""decided"" it was.
If anyone would like I'll doxx myself. You can see my ID to verify my name, my marriage license, and my husband's death certificate. I will then link you to the news article of the ""freak industrial accident"" that ended his life so you can see it's the same person.
As for not choosing hospice for my son - I can't. About a year ago I myself was hospitalized with severe depression and C-PTSD (there is proof of that too). During that time my late husbands mother petitioned to get control as my son's medical proxy and got it. I'm fighting it but it's a long, complicated process. There are competency hearings. There are statements from doctors and evaluations. Unless SHE oks hospice, which she refuses, I cannot decide that. I have custody. I cannot ake medical decisions. She agreed to residential care which I feel is the second best option. So, he's going into residential care.
As for ""mistaking"" a child choking with hitting, I was downstairs. I couldn't hear what my older son was saying. I only knew he was speaking. Go punch a blanket or, idk, a person with weak muscle tone. Then ask said person with weak muscle done to cough. They don't cough normally/forcefully. It's more a ""strong puff"". Similar to, again.... idk... a muted punch. When you're used to jumping at every strange sound, it's difficult to discern what's what sometimes.

School & life got away from me, and I forgot about them for a while.  That was until the end of the semester when I got a late library dues bill in the mail.  I think the fees were 25 cents per book per day - if not more - and I had at least 10 books over a month  late!  I didn't have any money, and if you had outstanding library dues, you could not get your grades/transcript for the semester.
Instead of sheepishly returning the books and paying the fines, I put the books in my backpack, smuggled them into the library, and returned them all to their correct places on the shelves.  I then called the library the next day and questioned the validity of the letter regarding my overdue books.
The librarian left me on hold for a few minutes and returned to the phone apologizing to me that it seemed the books had in fact been returned!

We've been married 20 years. 4 kids. So we are stable and we have lots in common at this point. And we do love each other. But if I could go back and slap myself I would.
What nobody tells you- or they try and you don't listen because you're a dumbass teenager- is that marrying like this means you will fucking owe him. For everything. Every goddamn day. Not just in the bedroom but in every other matter in your life. The stuff you never imagined someone else trying to decide for you. And you don't just owe him for the money. It's a lot heavier than that. He'll never say it out loud. But you'll know the deal. Fundamentally unequal.

My father was a raging asshole. He used to beat us and yell at us about how worthless we were constantly. My mother finally had enough, and said that either he gets psychological help, or she leaves him. He went to the doctor, and was prescribed an antipsychotic medication. When he started taking it, he magically became nice! No more beatings, no more yelling... it was paradise. Then, after a while, he turned mean again. We asked our Mom what was going on, and she said that he stopped taking his medication because he didn't like the side effects, whatever that meant. We felt doomed. Until one day, my mom accidentally? left his prescription bottle in the kitchen. My sister and I looked at each other and didn't even have to say a thing. She got out a spoon and I ground the white pill into powder, and we put it in his orange juice. What a nice day we had! We did this every single day, enjoying our temporary happy home, until the prescription ran out. It was the best month of our childhood, and I'm not sorry.
Edit:
For those saying that antipsychotics take weeks to work, that’s not always the case (in contrast, antidepressants often take weeks to work).

I had to make the right turn abut 7:20am every day. For a long time I would just break the law and make my turn any way or go around if I thought there was too many people watching. But (maybe out of boredom) I did a bit of research and found the ticket for the illegal turn was more than buying a sign from the supplier that makes signs for our area and several other locations. So I ordered a new sign that was 'no right turn between 7:30am- 9:30am'. I figured it was a good investment. I went to the trouble of buying it through an alias and having it sent to a location that was not at all near to where I was. Real cloak and dagger stuff, but it was part of the fun.
Then in the middle of the night I went and removed two bolts and put up the new sign.
At first I was expecting for it to be removed or someone look into to it, but it is more than a decade later and no one ever noticed or changed it.
BTY, Yes I did think of just taking it down, but I figured that would be noticed by someone, and to be honest the whole scheme of getting a new one was part of the fun.

Years ago, I went on a date with this girl who was obsessed with peanut butter. She kept pushing me to try her peanut butter smoothie, even after I said I wasn’t in the mood. Instead of just saying no, I blurted out, ""Oh, I can’t—I’m allergic.""
Big mistake.
She was super concerned, asked a million questions, and I figured, whatever, I’d never see her again. But then she introduced me to her friend group. And they all knew about my ""allergy."" At that point, correcting it felt too awkward.
Fast forward six years. I’m still friends with these people. My “allergy” is a known fact. They warn restaurants for me, they check ingredients, one of them even threw out a peanut butter cake someone brought to a party ""just to be safe.""
The worst part? I love peanut butter. I eat it in secret. I have a stash at work. Once, my best friend said, ""Man, it must suck not knowing what a Reese’s tastes like."" And I just nodded solemnly.
Now, my girlfriend (who also believes I’m allergic) wants us to move in together… and she’s super cautious about food. I’m terrified she’ll find my peanut butter stash and think I’ve been LYING TO HER.
Which I have. For years.
I have no idea how to get out of this. Do I fake a ""miracle recovery""? A medical misdiagnosis? Or do I just keep the lie going forever?

Lights behind me so I pull over. I know I’ve barely got any gas at all and was almost to a gas station, hence why I rolled through the stop a little. Trying not to have the car die.
At the time (around 1995) a new digital phone had come out called Voicesteam (now TMoblie) and their whole big thing was the phones were digital and not cellular. They were the first phones with caller ID and one of the big things the salesman had said over and over was since it was digital the signal couldn’t be triangulated or traced. Not that I cared but it stuck in my mind.
Well as I give the cop my license, registration and insurance card I got an idea. I knew if I was late to work I was going to lose my job. They were super strict there.
So I get an idea and right after I hand the papers to the cop and he’s walking back to his cruiser I called 911 and tell the operator I just saw a guy with what looked like a shot gun walk into a 7-11 that was about 2 blocks away. I confirmed the address then I hung up.
About 30 seconds later the cops comes sprinting to my car and hands me all my stuff and rushed says, “come to a complete stop next time!!” Then peels off to the direction of the store.
Pushed my car to the gas station that I’d almost made it to and felt pretty pleased with my ingenuity.
I was an idiot and I confess!
Edit: Wow, this blew up.  I forgot to mention I would have gotten arrested, booked and released, because I was driving with a suspended license for unpaid traffic tickets and I had a bench warrant for it.  Because I’m an idiot!

The best part? I got a promotion and a raise, which basically translates to ""we're paying you more to keep pretending you're good at this.""
Edit: Thanks, I feel so supported by the huge IT and developer community! :)
At least I've learned surprisingly fast and also that truth is told by how you work. 
Action over words.
Maybe after all, I can call myself a real programmer now?",

A lot of people were asking for an update so here it is.
I wrote up a long ass apology letter that I wanted to read to my brother. I waited until he got home and got into bed for the night.
I knocked on his door and he was so fucking excited that it was me. I couldn't even get through the first few words. I started crying after saying ""I wanted to say I'm really sorry"" and just couldn't get through it.
I just got into bed with him and laid down next to him. He hugged me really tight and said ""I missed you buddy"".
I fucking lost it. I never cried that bad before. He just hugged me for a long time until I calmed down. We didn't talk much. He started crying for a bit too. It was the first time in a long time we just hugged. After half an hour I got up and gave him a kiss and he told me he was so happy. Why didn't I do this earlier, fuck.
I thought I could I try apologizing properly again tomorrow. I left him the note to read anyway.
I am feeling very hopeful right now and a lot of pressure in my heart is gone. I swear to God and on my own life I will never treat my brother so badly again.
I have been working part-time for the past year and I was saving some money so my brother and my mom could go on a trip to a place he really wanted to go to. But I think I will take my brother myself instead (when I turn 18).
I also realized that I need to have a relationship with my brother where I am not just taking care of him. It needs to be like a normal brother relationship. Like going for movies and stuff. It's going to take some time for me to fix the mess I created though. I'm just lucky my brother is amazing.
I received a lot of messages. I appreciate everyone for their input and I did read them all even if I didn't reply. Thanks everyone.
My actual post:
[Remorse]
I know this will get a lot of hate and yes I deserve it. I am not looking for any validation or forgiveness. I know I am a piece of human trash.
I just need to get this out.
I have a brother who is two years older then me. He has suffered from a condition since birth that forces him to be in a wheelchair anytime he is out of bed. He cannot use his arms that well either.
We used to have a great relationship until I turned 11 and I really started resenting the amount of attention he took from my parents. And how much stress he put them under.
I had to constantly help him, change him, feed him. I hated it.
There was a few years in his life when he so mean to my parents and it really made me resent him more.
I realize now that I had no right to judge him and I will never know how difficult life is for him.
I stopped hanging out with him and made more friends at school. I would tell my family all the fun I was having at school during dinner to make him feel bad.
I started barely talking to him or acknowledge his presence. He would get frustrated to the point of tears to get my attention.
It started escalating two years ago when I would purposely turn off the wifi and unplug the tv every time we had to leave the house so my brother could do nothing but sit in his wheelchair.
I would purposely delete his favorite saved shows on the DVR. I would make fun of his speech. Push things just out of his reach.
I would act disgusted when I had to change or bathe him. It always made him feel bad and he would apologize. I made my own brother apologize for taking a dump. What the fuck is wrong with me?
But my fucking saint of a brother never told my parents. And he never let me have it.
Three weeks ago, he was trying to talk to me non-stop and I was just ignoring him. I got annoyed and wheeled him against his wishes to the backyard and placed him under an umbrella and went back inside. I fell asleep and realized I left him out there for three hours.
When I went to bring him back inside he was in tears and wouldn't look at me. He was humiliated.
I have always felt guilty about how I treated my brother all these years but my anger towards him overpowered it. But seeing that look on his face affected me in a way that was different from before.
I stopped all the bullying after that day. I couldn't even look him in the face I was so ashamed.
Last Sunday my brother told me he was glad I was his brother and friend. I couldn't even respond. I went to my room and cried.
I'm fucking crying again typing this all out. When did I become an evil trash human being? Fuck.
I'm 17 and he's 19 now. I know there is nothing I can do to make up for the past 6 years.
My brother will be returning with my mom from a specialist appointment tonight. I'm going to apologize to him and beg for his forgiveness tonight. I want to start being being a fucking decent brother to him again.
I am a healthy guy with no issues who chose to bully his only brother for something that wasn't even his fault. I am so ashamed of myself.",

confession,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1n5zrdq/i_lied_to_my_pickme_friend_and_she_got_a_tattoo/,32183,1496,I lied to my pick-me “friend” and she got a tattoo based off of it,"🚨🚨🚨UPDATE AT BOTTOM🚨🚨🚨
It’s been about 2 years since this happened-but I just got confirmation from a friend who attended her tattoo appointment that it was because of what I said.
The Backstory:
I (25F) was introduced to Peggy (fake name)(25F) through a mutual friend. She had recently moved in to a friend’s neighboring apartment unit and was quickly introduced to our friend group. Almost immediately, I could tell we weren’t going to get along based off of some backhanded compliments that were given; but I decided that it was too quick to judge her fairly and invited her to a game night that a friend and I were hosting.
Huge mistake.
Game one: Sardines. During a drunken game of sardines in the dark, Peggy faked a fall and pushed my head into a shelf. How do I know she faked it? Because she literally told me in front of everyone and LAUGHED about it saying “I found him first- that’s why I pushed you”.
Game two: Kings cup. Peggy called me out during the “never have I ever” portion for having gone through a divorce. Talking about it normally wouldn’t have bothered me since everyone who was there already knew about it and were really supportive during that time- but it was the fact that she was trying to single me out and shame me for it.
Throughout the rest of the night this kind of behavior continued, and by the end, I was thoroughly convinced she had some sort of vendetta against me. Finding out what -or in my case WHO- it was, took almost no time at all.
One of our friends (who we’ll call Mark) was in attendance that first night. Mark (28M) is a tall, kind, funny, and generally attractive guy. Essentially, he’s catnip for her type. At this time, we were pretty close friends and Peggy did not like that. For the next 6 months, anytime he was around I had to deal with the most ridiculous, awkward, and petty attempts of her trying to single me out or embarrass me.
Now here’s where the tattoo comes into play:
I had been planning on getting a dragon tattoo for over a year. I am fully aware that dragons are a common and trending tattoo, but I wanted it anyways because it was special to me and my mom. I had even worked with my tattoo artist on incorporating her favorite flowers into the piece and figuring out what kind of style/other details I wanted.
About a month before my appointment, Peggy heard a friend and I talking about the tattoo and started asking questions. I swear I could see the moment the lightbulb went off in her head because she grew the biggest sh*t-eating grin I have ever seen.
My lightbulb moment happened shortly after.
When she asked where and what kind of dragon tattoo I wanted to get, I lied. I told her about how much I loved the movie “Spirited Away” (because I do- it’s a banger) and went on a tangent about how I grew up on that movie, how my dad showed it to me, and that, “it’d be cool if he (Haku) was wrapping around my arm or something”.
(If you haven’t seen the movie, one of the main characters is a boy named Haku who turns into a dragon)
Peggy had never seen this movie before, so I encouraged her to check it out and ended the conversation there.
Now, considering she had never seen it before, I didn’t think she’d actually do it. But Reddit. She did it. And it wasn’t just a tiny-cutesy little thing either. She committed to my EXACT DESCRIPTION. The thing is freaking huge🤣😭😭
When she showed it to me two weeks later, I was in shock and she probably thought I was upset for taking something from me. But I went home that night and switched between feeling awful for lying to her and laughing for how utterly unbelievable she was for doing it. 2 years later and I’m still doing that.
I had confessed to a friend recently about my lie and that’s when she told me. She went to the tattoo appointment with Peggy that day. And word for word Peggy had said, “She’s going to be so upset. This is like the exact tattoo she wanted”.
Edit for FAQ:
Regarding the girl who went to the appointment with Peggy: We didn’t become friends until after this all happened. At the time we were only acquaintances and she ended up dropping her as a friend for her own personal reasons after. We discovered later in our friendship our mutual distaste for Peggy, but this also wasn’t the crux of our friendship.
Neither her or I dated Mark. I had turned him down early in our friendship before she came into the picture. Don’t get me wrong- Mark is a catch, but he deserves someone who’s crazy about him and that just wasn’t me. We sorted our friendship out prior to this whole mess, and hopefully he can find a healthy middle ground of crazy lol. He was pretty oblivious to the whole thing, and I didn’t need him to sort it out for me, so he didn’t know until way after.
Didn’t know how to edit a post until now but here you go. Face is blocked out for obvious reasons but I don’t follow her socials so you guys will have to settle for her cropped pfp.
The Haku Tattoo
I’ll keep you guys posted if I have any updates- for now this is just a confession into the void
🚨🚨🚨UPDATE🚨🚨🚨
I finally showed this post to the friend who went with her to the appointment; and she was kind enough to supply a picture of the tattoo in progress.😭
Haku in progress
The crazy thing is- she did this to her too with a tattoo commemorating her favorite music artist😭
From her:
“I initially wanted the tattoo bc he’s literally my favorite artist and so I sent my artist (the one you met) my reference photo and she said she wanted to come bc she was thinking about getting one too. So we get there and he started doing my stencil and stuff and when she saw she said “oh my gosh that’s so cute it would be so cool if we got matching tattoos!” I (being excited and at this point having no issues with her whatsoever) was like yeah girl it’s your body so I just was like okay and let it happen, ig it’s a momento for her🤷🏻‍♀️ She got the exact same thing and exact same placement too”
🚨Final🚨
To the readers who are asking me to show this to her to get her reaction- I don’t live there anymore, so I can’t. I CAN say however, one of her friends found this post and reached out to me on Reddit trying to get me to say my name😅 I didn’t. Since then, Peggy has changed her pfp lol",

They told me No one had contacted them yet but they will put it back in the bank and if someone comes and asks they will look at the balance at the end of the month or something like that.

When I worked there they were in the process of phasing out denominational gift certificates. ($5, $10 & $25) 
The way is worked was if you spent more than half of the certificate they gave you the cash back. So if you ordered $5.50 worth of food and gave them one of the $10 gift cards, they gave you the $4.50 back in cash. My manager was in charge of destroying all the existing certificates as we transitioned to the more traditional credit card looking gift cards.
So my manager said he shredded the certificates like he was supposed to, but one night when I was closing I found two boxes of the gift cards tucked deep in the dry storage room. They were FILLED with the certificates that were supposed to be shredded. So, I scooped them up, brought them out to the dumpster in trash bags and threw them away. After we closed, I came back and recovered the back, and brought the certificates home. I counted them. There were 1,000 $25, 1,000 $10, and 500 $5 certificates. None of them had expiration dates. Total haul was $40K in fast food certificates. 
My manager never said a word, he couldn't. He had reported them destroyed weeks earlier.
Over the next three years my girlfriend and I toured every location in our state, and the next 4 states ordering food, and getting the change. We never kept track on a spreadsheet or anything, but we got good at knowing what menu items were just about half.
After the first year, we started saving the change in a shoe box, and let it build up.
I bought my first car for $7,800 cash from the change.
And for some reason A kiddie cone was $1.05, if you gave them a $5 cert they gave you $3.95 back. We threw away a lot of kiddie cones.
Edit:
Holy crap this blew up.  Here are the answers to some of the FAQs
We could hit 10-12 stores in a day if we drove around for 5-6 hours.  Both of us would use a gift cert.  it was not that labor intensive.
The only cameras in the store were at the cash registers & take out window.
The manager has no clue who took them, or at least never treated my differently.
Each gift certificate had a generic PLU on them.  E.i. All the $25 were PLU #756.
When we stopped selling the certificates we were told to keep honoring them because they were pre paid.  They were not coupons.

Apparently lots of people have strong feelings about the elf. The kids and I had an awesome holiday.

If you’re hanging on by a thread and your cup is empty and one more thing to remember is the last thing you want to do, be kind to yourself. Your kids would rather spend time with a less stressed parent than to have all this extra stuff.",

I haven’t talked about this to anyone (even though it’s been years) even my closest of friends, minus the ones that were there.
One nite when I was in college I was driving to get some liquor for a party my fraternity was supposed to throw the following night.
I was taking a street I was very familiar with to get back to my house.  It was dark but the street was lit with street lamps.  I remember that I looked at my radio for a second, just a second not very long at all.  But when I looked back up to the road  there was a man crossing.
I didn’t have any time to react, by the time I saw him he had already hit the good of my car and bounced off the side.  I remember screaming and hitting the brakes, and the wash of horror of what had just happened.  I’ll admit I had thought about speeding away, but I pulled over to the side and ran out of my car to check on this guy.
When I got to him his family was standing outside the restaurant he was leaving and they were all screaming and crying.  He has laying on the side of the road with blood coming out his nose and mouth. Two other men were standing with him trying to see if he was alright and calling 911.  All I could say was “I didn’t see him” I was frantic by the time it had set in what I had done.
I sat on the curb across from the family and listened to their crying in agony while we waited for the paramedics to arrive.  I sat there and sobbed while to paramedics took him away in an ambulance.  I don’t believe I’ve ever cried so hard and for so long.  The worst part about all of it and what still kills me today was that his wife came over to me while I was distraught on that curb, sat next to me, placed her hand on my shoulder and said “I was married to him for almost 50 years.  We had a good life.” Then she hugged me and said that she forgave me.
After everything was said and done it was ruled that it was an accident.  I wasn’t charged with anything and I had one of my friends pick me up from the police station.  I went down a dark path the years after that.  I drank heavily, dropped out of college in my senior year, and had to move back in with my mother and father because I couldn’t hold on to a job.  Even tried to kill myself with pills.  It was a hard road to recovery (witch I feel I’m not fully recovered from nor do I feel I ever will be the same). But eventually I got my life back in order.  Joined up with the Navy and saw a bit of the world, and now I’m on track to go back to college and hopefully finish what I started there.   It took almost a decade but I finally start to feel almost whole again.  I’m back to hanging with my friends, and actually going out.  So maybe there is a light at the end of the tunnel.
Wow, you guys are awesome! Thanks for the support and feedback.  I’ve never really posted anything on reddit before because people can be assholes, but all these kind words are moving. Thank you!

I was in charge of going through the socks, underwear, bras, shoes, purses, and bedding. Additionally, we would collect brand new stuff and hold them back for a “sale” we would have four times a year with all the brand new stuff. We happened to get six or eight brand new bras and one of my coworkers boxed them up for our sale. At least four months went by between the time we boxed up these bras and the next time I saw them again, so they weren’t new, and if someone had noticed something was missing and came in asking for them back, we would try our best to find their items as long as we could. We never heard anything about them. A week before everything goes out onto the floor for the sale, we check everything over, make sure it’s priced, and price them if needed. These bras in their boxes were something that needed priced and I pulled one out of the box. Behind it was a thick bank envelope with nothing written on it. I opened a desk drawer and put the envelope inside there. I grabbed it when I went on my lunch break, and it was full of cash. After counting it, I realized it was $8,000 and put it in my bag without saying a word to anyone and didn’t tell anyone I worked with until I left there, and undersold how much it was by a LOT, telling them it was a few hundred. I never heard anything about it and no one ever asked anything about the box, so I don’t think the person that donated even knew they did.
Part of that money was used to help me get a car so I didn’t have to walk to work anymore.",

They got back together and got married.","This was back in... let me think, maybe 1997? I was 38 and my daughter was 18, and she was dating Harry, who was 24. I was an alcoholic and dabbled in other drugs, mostly cocaine. I was not a good person, let alone mother. Not like I was abusive to my daughter or anything but I was generally inattentive and cared more about my alcohol and drugs than her, especially in her teen years. I am 14 years sober now.
I disproved of my daughter dating harry, but I never told her why. He would flirt with me, constantly, and the age difference also creeped me out. Also, he was an alcoholic and drug user, just like me. She broke up with him over his alcoholism.
Soon after she moved away, not too far but regardless she didn't live with me anymore. Harry kept calling me and asking if we wanted to get drinks, I turned him down, but then one day he said he had a bunch of coke and I couldn't resist. He came over, we did the coke, and we ended up having sex. He was a very good looking guy. He looked A LOT like that ridiculous 80s justin beiber picture that was on the front page today, that is actually what made me think about him.
For the next few months, maybe like 3-4 months, he would sometimes come over and we would have sex and do drugs and get drunk together. Any drug addict knows what that is like to have a drug addict buddy in that way.
Then I got pregnant. I knew it was by him, I had sex without a condom a few times stupidly. I never told him I was pregnant, and I went and got the abortion and kept it a secret.
Anyways, I stopped seeing him after that, it was too weird. I also got sober, for like 4 months, before relapsing. Fast forward 2 years and my daughter contacts me and tells me that she got back with Harry, and that he is fully sober. I was mortified honestly. He was gonna tell her that we slept together, and she is going to hate me for life. They came over one day and said hi, and when my daughter was gone, Harry told me that there is no reason to tell her about what happened. I agreed.
Its been 16 years of marriage on their part. They have a kid together. Harry got cancer, then beat it. I got sober. That's basically it.
I don't see them very often, they live in texas and I live on the east coast. But whenever I do there is always that tension between me and Harry, its literally the first thing that comes to either of our minds, I can just tell. Not like sexual tension, like ""why did we have to do that? What the fuck is wrong with us?"" kind of tension.
I think about this often. Especially when I see my grandson. I always think that could have been my son if things had gone differently, but WOW what a disaster that would have been if I decided to keep that child.",

Her dad picked her up as I had an early meeting. She vomited in his new car. Just basically burped & biffed everywhere.
He got her home, told her to shower & cleaned his truck as much as he could at 2 AM.
She came down while he was cleaning & he told to just go to bed & don’t worry about it.
She went to bed. Next day he’s filling me in on everything & did a deep clean on the truck.
He was grossed out, but not mad. Never raised his voice, made sure she was ok & just did what he had to do.
She & I spoke about it & it just hit me out of no where…she never thought for a second we were angry. She never even worried we were going to flip out. It was an accident. Not the end of the world.
We both come from families who - if you made a mistake - you were made to feel like the biggest disappointment ever. Where you were at fault & you ruined everything & you don’t deserve to be loved. We had to walk on eggshells & earn love in our homes.
Our girls don’t feel that way at all. They never doubt our love. And god damn, that feels so amazing!

I'm writing this as a confession because I don't know where else to speak about this and I don't want my kids finding this out on my main account.
My friend died a few months back due to heart problems. He was taking care of himself so it was a shock to everyone. Especially his wife who was with him at their house when he died. Due to this she decided to move somewhere else and because she and her daughter were still distraught she asked me to pack up his stuff.
He had some boxes in his basement and after a while I started feeling nostalgic and decided to look into them. I found pictures of us from when we were kids all the way to before we got married. That was enough to make me feel bad and I just got back to taping them up.
But one of the boxes seemed to be in much better condition, so I decided to check it in case it was something important. To my surprise I found out pictures of him and my wife from when we used to hang out together, as well as more recent pictures from family reunions. The most recent being from my wife's birthday party.
Alongside the pictures there were letters that he never sent her. The first one dated 2 months before I met her. The last one was also the same date of her birthday party. There was one that stood out the most was one from after I started dating her. He wrote that his time had passed and since my happiness was as important as his own he would watch over us.
I'll keep his box safe since it isn't my secret to reveal.",

In the early 80's, ATM's had a feature called ""deposit with cash back"". It was a check cashing feature but for some reason it ran on the honor system. Of course, this feature went away, eventually. But I figured out that if I just put an empty envelope into the ATM and I didn't seal it, I could claim that the bank lost it. So the ATM would cash the check then a week later the bank was like ""uh that envelope was empty"". For whatever reason, Bay Bank let me get away with that.
That summer my family stayed in a cottage in Hyannis for two weeks. During that time, I opened savings accounts at 5 different banks, using the rented house address. They mailed me ATM cards within a few says. I deposited with cash back on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and early Monday. Back then the limit was $400. and they were going to check the ATMs by Monday so the scam would be over.
I scored 10,000 1984 dollars. No one ever came looking for it. I was never questioned or arrested. I don't understand why or how. The only thing that happened was the FDIC had me on a list of people who banks shouldn't do business with. I didn't even find out about that til I was 21, five years after the crime. I was in college and tried to open and bank account and no bank would let me.
40 years later, I have a bank account, and nothing ever happened. It's the only time in my life that I had good luck.
Of course, I blew the money. Back then it was enough to put down on a house or easily bought a car.  I spent it on girls, weed and beer. It was fun but I wish I was smarter.",

Especially because we don't have the money to be doing that.
So in work I get a lunch allowance of whatever I want, but I just say I'm not hungry or don't have time to eat it and wrap up some nice sandwich or wrap so my wife can have it for her lunch.

I've been trying to lose weight for years now, and while I have had some results, I am still technically clinically obese, though not morbidly.
My sister is also obese, but is closer to morbidly obese than I am. Yesterday, I went on Instagram and her profile popped up, so I decided to scroll through it since I haven't seen her in almost 5 years and don't really look at my family members' social media. As I was scrolling, I came across one of her selfies and was hit with the realization that her face is my face. I had never realized just how similar we looked, but her selfie was the same face I see in the mirror everyday, and I'm horrified. I know it sounds awful, but my sister has always been the ugliest of the kids in my family, so realizing I look at all like her is not particularly pleasant.
I realized that one of the reasons we look so similar was because of our face shape, very round and pudgy. Seeing her and realizing how ugly I think she is and realizing how similar we look has given me extreme motivation to lose the weight and keep it off. I can't do anything about our facial features without surgery, but hopefully by losing weight I will be able to think that we look different and won't feel so awful about my appearance.
Anyway, I know that I'm an awful sister for saying so bluntly that I think my sister is actively ugly, but it's true. And it's not just her face, she also doesn't take care of herself, has hair that's been overdyed and is stringy and gross now, and recently got several face piercings (you can have your own opinion, but I think they're ugly 99% of the time). I'm probably going to see her in just over a year, so I really need to lose the weight by then for fear that anyone will comment on how similar we look.",

It was around 11 PM, and I had just gotten home from a late shift. I live in a small apartment in a not-so-great part of the city, so I’m always a little on edge when walking home. That night felt… off. As I was unlocking my door, I noticed a guy standing at the end of the hallway. He wasn’t doing anything, just standing there, but something about him made my stomach drop.
I got inside, locked the door, and tried to shake it off. Not even five minutes later, someone knocked. Hard. I froze. It wasn’t my neighbor (she texts before coming over), and I don’t really have friends who drop by unannounced.
Then, a voice - “Please, can you just let me in for a second?”
It was a woman. She sounded out of breath, almost panicked. I looked through the peephole, and there she was, maybe mid 20ish, wide eyes, glancing down the hall like she was being followed.
I know, I
know
, stupid move, but I cracked the door open just a little and asked her what is going on.
She whispered that there’s a guy, he’s been following her since she left the train. She didn’t know where else to go from there. That’s when I realized. The guy I saw earlier...
My heart was racing, but I stepped aside and let her in. I locked the door immediately, turned off the lights, and we just stood there in the dark, listening. A few seconds later, heavy footsteps passed my door. Slow. Like someone was looking for something. Then… nothing.
She stayed for about thirty minutes, just sitting on my couch, shaking. I offered her water, and we barely talked. Eventually, she called a friend to come pick her up.
When she left, she just said thank you and disappeared down the hall. I never saw her again.
I don’t know if she was telling the truth. Maybe she was genuinely in danger. But I think about that night all the time, and I can’t decide if I did the right thing… or if I got really, really lucky.",

With medically complex kids you fix one problem and create two more.
She lived 11 years. It was probably 9 years too long. She lived most of her life in hospitals. Literally months at a time. She would sometimes be home a week or two and then end up back in. I don't think she ever spent more than two consecutive months out of the hospital in her entire life, until she went on palliative care.
She was more comfortable in the hospital than anywhere else. How sad is that. She was the ""warrior"" kid. That was her whole identity. Making cards for her nurses and decorating her medical equipment and being Tough with a capital T. That was all she had. Never went to school, not in any meaningful capacity. Never played a sport or an instrument. Never had any real friends to speak of. Never had the health to take up any real hobbies. Just an entire life made up of surgeries, shots and nurses and fucking medical equipment to decorate. I gave her a pathetic life.
There wasn't a single intervention I wasn't willing to put her through to buy more time. She was the happiest, most accepting kid I've ever met but in the last six months she was done. I refused to listen. She asked me over and over again if she could just ""stop"". I would push until she shut up and went along with what I wanted. Why did I do that. She wanted to make me happy but she knew she was done. Selfish. She died incredibly agitated and upset. I think she was scared to let go because she knew what it was going to do to me. I wasn't strong enough to let go. I'm so so sorry.",

I work remotely at a very large fortune 50 company, Monday through Friday, for 40 hours a week. At least those are the hours that I’m “on.“ Starting around noon every workday, I take a one and a half to two hour lunch break. I purposely block off my calendar with “busy work“ so no one questions what I’ve been doing. I honestly cannot find enough hours in the week to be able to do half of the stuff that I need to be able to get done, because that’s just part of my job. There is a ton of project management and follow up with various clients. But that’s just about everyone on my team. 
For some reason, my boss has never questioned me or been suspicious of anything. My intuition tells me that he might do the same thing himself on his remote days, although he has a hybrid schedule. And that’s not all. 
I have taken vacations before during lighter project weeks, where a lot of communication isnt required between me and my team. I took my laptop and logged on during mandatory meetings and then logged off right afterwards. I know there is a lot of talk out there by corporate CEOs saying return to the office is mandatory because of stuff like this, but I always hit my goals, I do everything that’s asked of me, and I exceed expectations every year during my performance review. Honestly, this is the first time in my career where I feel like I have a “normal“ work/life balance. I feel like this is what work really should be. 30-32 hours of core work, while enjoying life the way it should be enjoyed. Some of the happiest moments of my life have been playing with my toddler son and watching him grow up during my lunch hour. Sorry, not sorry.",

I’m a 19 year old non religious woman who just really dislikes being around other people. I also have a lot of friends/ colleagues who lives in the same area as me that I often see at bus stops, shops etc. To avoid being recognised by people, I usually wear a niqab, (face and body covering veil) whenever I go out to run errands. I usually wait until no one is at the same street as my house before I leave, as it would seem weird that a random woman in a niqab would regularly leave or go into my home. Though I do get stares since I live in a non- muslim country, it is still very common for women to wear hijabs in my city, and you do see a woman in a full coverage veil sometimes. Even though I get stares, I feel so much more comfortable knowing that no one can actually see or recognise me.

Our whole family doesn’t talk to her. She’s done things in the past you wouldn’t believe. So she left our lives years ago. Recently she returned out of the blue at my moms house. My mom has 2 other sisters and a brother. My mom and aunt never got on. My mom is a lovely person but she could sense from a young age something was off about her sister, so she kept her distance.
My Aunt was nasty and would hurt people’s feeling intentionally for no reason. She never had a partner or kids. She isolated herself from everyone. My Gran cut her off when she tried to steal thousands of dollars from her. We all genuinely think there’s something physiologically wrong with her.
So back to where I was going with this....one morning I was at my moms house. Just chilling out and there was a knock at the door. So I opened it and there she was. She walked in, she looked like she had took drugs. She looked dead behind the eyes. I tried to stop her but she pushed me down. I honestly don’t know why she came to my moms house out of everyone. I quickly got up and she went into the kitchen she startled my mom and punched her in the face, my mom didn’t even have a chance to blink before she hit her. She went down like a ton of bricks.
My heart felt like it had been sucked through into my stomach when I seen it. Something came over me, I don’t know if it was anger or adrenaline, but I ran up behind her and grabbed her hair and I dragged her out onto the back lawn and I bashed her face about 15 times, blood was everywhere. Thankfully no one seen me or I might not of been writing this right now. I got up and I left her there. I went to check my mom, she was in a lot of pain. I looked back out the window and she was gone.
We told our family immediately about this and they were perplexed and angry as to why she just turned up and attacked my mom. I’m still so hurt and angry as I write this. But I also feel tremendously guilty and upset that I done that to her because I’ve never fought anyone and I’m not a fighter at all, but something came over me and I snapped.
I can’t get over it for some reason. It just seemed so unreal and there was no reason for the attack. God forbid she had a weapon that’s truly scary to think about. We didn’t call the police. As I assaulted her badly and didn’t want it to bounce back on me. That’s another thing I feel ashamed about.
But should I feel bad or not? I need others opinions as I’ve been bottling this up for a while.
My Gran was devastated, she just wanted her daughter back but from a young age she took to drugs, spent time in prison and amount of other things. You can’t help someone who doesn’t want to be saved.",

The offer was really meant for people sitting in the store but I would buy coffee in the morning and then bring my cup back around 1 or 2p for another cup. Apparently in NYC, they weren’t allowed to actually refill the cup for health code reasons or something. So they’d throw out the cup and give you a new one. That’s when I realized there was a loophole here.
I kept five cups and brought them home. Then I started bringing one in the morning to Starbucks and I’d get a free “refill”. I’d do this every day and I’d end up with 5 gross paper Starbucks cups at work and then I’d bring them home on Friday and repeat the next week. I did this for months, not paying for coffee at all, until one day I brought in my cup and handed it to the barista for a refill only to realize that all of the cups behind the counter were different. It was getting close to the holidays and they’d switched to their holiday logo cups. Well, color me embarrassed. I started paying for coffee again after that. It was a good run though.",

I tried talking to them, telling them my boyfriend and I work at a coffee shop and bakery and our hours were really early. I bribed them with treats I made.
They were constantly opening their windows and playing their music so loud for hours at all hours. Even their conversations were loud. With their windows open, even with mine closed I would know when their mom was visiting, when their boyfriends weren’t texting them back, or when they got their nails done. I did everything to cover it up. Music of my own, fans for white noise, tv, etc. it’s like they knew when I was actively trying and stepped up their game to be louder. Eventually we tried talking to landlords, made noise complaints, everything. They just learned how to be sneaky about being loud. Eventually it got spiteful. Putting music in the window, screaming and banging on the walls. Our houses weren’t connected but there was maybe a max of 10ft in between with a sidewalk going through. I was getting really stressed out. Losing sleep, couldn’t relax in my house, was getting sent home from work because I was so tired. It got really bad and I had no idea what to do. Nothing we had done up to this point had worked.
When I’d explain my situation people would come up with funny revenge ideas. None of them stuck like the skunk tincture did to me. I could feel it in my bones it would work. So I ordered some on amazon and one morning as I left for work I dumped it all along the side of their house that they keep the windows open on. It smelled so bad I was worried I was gonna get some on me and I’d smell bad at work. I didn’t.
Fast forward a couple hours and I get a notification on our camera that there’s motion. It faced in between the two houses along the sidewalk, the place I dumped the tincture. One of the girls was walking back and forth up the sidewalk spraying the rocks under the windows with Lysol. I watched it for a while and more came out. One opened the window and pulled the screen off and wiped it all down. Eventually a maintenance guy showed up. Then the gas company. I kinda started to panic at that point. I felt kinda bad, like maybe I had gone too far. I don’t think they ever figured it out or suspected me.
For the next 2 months those windows stayed shut and I barely heard anything from them. It was so peaceful. I couldn’t believe it worked.",

I didn't realise until I worked in care how rude, arrogant, entitled, nasty, racist, homophobic some elderly are. Out of all 80 plus only about 8 are actually decent. They are so disgustingly rude it's unbelievable and this is even the ones who are non dementia.
Dementia crowd are a different breed. Some of lovely, some are the most awful people I've ever met and before you guys go crazy and scream but it's their dementia!!!! Yes. Some of it. But there's still a human being under the dementia and there's no way calling one of my black colleagues a monkey, n***ga, wog and specifically attacking them for being black (or our Indian ladies) is new to them. That's been there for decades. One guy looked at one of our new african sponsorships and said ""get back on your banana boat and fuck off""
They treat us younger people literally like we are their maids, barking their every want at us when they can see we are busy. They hurt us, berate us, go out their way to make our job more difficult. One lady (non dementia) threw her dinner plate with her dinner on at me because I got her husbands sugar wrong in his tea.
I was targeted and attacked my entire pregnancy. Zimmer frame to the stomach, punched in the stomach, spat at, had a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher sprayed at me when I was heavily pregnant, told I should be ashamed of my mixed race baby. One new entry came in and only lasted 4 hours before his previous care home was called to take him back as he chased me saying he wanted to kill me and my baby. I've had shit thrown at me, my hair pulled, dirty nails dug into my skin and scratched.
Another guy threatened to rape my younger colleague which really upset her.
They're just vile. I'm sick and tired of saying we need to respect our elders and they're sweet little innocent cuties. There's some really nice ones sure! And I absolutely love doing care with them. But the others are just so nasty.
Edit: just an add on.. in my experience schizophrenic people (medicated) are the sweetest people ever. We have a gentleman who is on injections each month and he's a HUGE guy. Big, muscly, 6 foot plus. He's in his 60s and he's so lovely and often tries to protect female staff from other male residents. Our schizophrenic ladies have their moments but generally are really kind and really intelligent too.",

I was 15 and my friends were 14 and 16. I was away at another friend’s house one night. When I came back the following day my mom told me she had kicked them out because the 16yo tried to make a move on my dad. She absolutely slandered that poor girl’s name.
When I got into my 20s it still sat in the back of my mind. I just knew I didn’t get the truth. So I reached out to the 16yo who was also now in her 20s. We met up and I got the true story. I could see the pain in her eyes. She said she’d been in therapy for years because of my father. That he did it in such a loving way, it really fucked her up. She told me they’d been drinking on the property then went skinny dipping. All while my mother was in bed pregnant with my sister. They made their way into the house and upstairs. Where eventually my mother walked in on them. I let her know I had her back if she ever decided to do anything about it.
I am now in my 30s and recently became a mother and it’s all I’ve been able to think about. They still don’t know that I know the truth. It’s reawakened the rage in me. Especially all of the teenage rage they made me shove down for so long. Because if anyone did that to my daughter, or if I caught my husband in that situation, HELLLLLLL NO. It was easy to shove down before because I learned from the best, my parents. But becoming a mother, especially to a daughter, I’ve never wanted someone to pay for something they’ve done so bad.
I feel like if I brought it up to my mom she would just get angry and talk shit. She’d probably say the past is the past and I need to let it go. That people can change. But I know he hasn’t changed due to events over the recent years with his anger and control issues. He’s a very big narcissist who believes he can do no wrong whatsoever. And my mother is so far up his ass. It makes me wonder if the 16yo was his only victim. If she was, and if he’s never done it again, would that be okay? Is this forgivable? Because I don’t feel like it is.
I want to tell the whole family, but I feel like they’d just downplay it and make me seem crazy. Cut me off and turn my siblings against me. They’ve done it before when I called them out on other things. So, here I am. Just needing to get it out I guess. What would you do?",

I got clean at 21 years old after years of abuse. I got married at 26 to my amazing and beautiful wife. She knows I was an addict.
I spent all these years not even really thinking that much about the concept of relapsing. It had been
so long
. I still thought about it, but with marriage and my kids and everything the thought of it was just so ridiculously out of sight to even consider trying it again.
3 weeks ago, it was my friends birthday. He is 4 years younger than me so of course he wants to go to some cool hip sketchy bar/club thing in bushwick.
I got drunk, really drunk. I hadn't really drank much at all in the past few years so my tolerance was way lower than expected. There was a dealer outside and a few other junkies nearby. I don't even fully remember what happened, I just remember going with them, abandoning my friend at the bar (it was like 1am anyways), and going to some apartment and shooting up. I spent the night there, then all the way until noon the next day. I had 10 missed calls.
I panicked when I came out of my daze. I told my wife I had gotten way too drunk and was puking and my phone was out of battery so I stayed at Charlies house. She was disappointed I didn't tell her but also thought it was funny because she used to tease me for not being able to handle my liquor. This was a ""I told you so"" moment, she had told me not to drink too much before I went to the bar. She wasn't even in new york, she was at a summer house with the kids in Massachusetts.
I spent the next 4 days until they got back just... riddled with anxiety, urges to get more heroin, horrific mind zaps (I dont even know what to call them). It was, in some ways, worse than my withdrawal symptoms when I first was an addict. Not because of the physical feeling, but the horrible mental feeling of what I was possibly giving up, my wife and kids. I wanted to fucking get more so badly. I left my house to find heroin 4 fucking times. 4 times, I gave up to get more, but wasn't able to find any and snapped back to reality and went back home. I still thank FUCKING GOD I did not somehow run into some street dealer during those 4 times. I would have absolutely done it.
I feel like everything I thought about myself, that I was strong, that my addiction was behind me, that I had beat heroin... it was all gone. I am not going to say I am back at square one or anything, I am not. But I feel like something inside of me has reset. My unwavering strength against addiction was broken at the slightest temptation. I still am weak. Heroin is so, so much stronger than me. Its truly unbelievable how much stronger it is than me.
When I was young, my aunt had cancer. She beat it. Then it came back soon after, and she beat it again. It didn't come back, and we loved how strong she was for fighting her cancer and that she had overcome it. She lived with us. I remember her feeling of strength after her 2nd year of not having cancer, her 3rd year, her 6th year.... it finally felt like it was gone for good. Her thinking ""its finally behind me now, its a part of my past"", and then it just fucking came back. 9 years after her first diagnosis, it came back and killed her. I remember her feelings and how she felt about it. So many years after she thought it had gone away.
That is how I feel. Like a cancer which I thought I got rid of a decade ago just showed back up on my screening.
The first 5-6 days after I tried it that time outside the bar were the worst. My kids and wife have come back. The urges mostly went away the second I saw my kids. I hugged them so damn hard.
And I never told my family what happened, nor will I ever. My wife never understood that side of me, she met me 5 whole years after I was clean. I just cannot have her know, ever.
I won't do it again. I am planning on not drinking to excess like that again, except maybe in very specific situations like at the summer house where there is no option of drugs. I mean, not like I WANT to get drunk again like that, but just in case I ever want to get loose? I am never doing that in the city again.
I am still about 90%+ sure that I won't ever touch heroin again. I am still positive in myself about it. Its just... it used to be 99% sure. That is what fucking terrifies me.
I said heroin is stronger than me. It is absolutely stronger than me. But the reason I won't ever do it again is that it isn't stronger than my family, my wife and kids. I don't care about how good it feels, I will not subject my wife and children to me being an addict. I would rather just kill myself than that.",
confession,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9cptbm/8_years_ago_i_caused_a_ufo_panic/,17607,441,8 years ago I caused a UFO panic,"One college summer break 8 years ago my friends and I were bored. We remembered a demonstration from a high school science class of a ""Solar Balloon"". This was just a really thin black plastic bag you'd fill with air, seal, and then set out in the sun. The sun would heat the air in the black bag and the bag would become buoyant and float.
We had the idea to find the cheapest/thinnest black plastic trash bags available and combine a bunch of them to make a huge balloon. We spent a few days driving around to Walmarts and dollar stores trying different brands to find the thinnest possible plastic bag and thinnest tape which would work the best. Finally we took a number of them, cut off the bottom ends, and taped them together into a huge balloon which we filled up with a leaf blower and then tied the end. After sitting out in the sun for a half hour or so we had done it!
This is a picture a friend had taken as it was just becoming buoyant.
We had to mess around with how the tape was sealing the bags to use as little of it as possible as the weight of the tape added up and made the balloon harder to float.
Shortly after this the balloon got away from us
Further
This was dissapointing, but we made another one and got funny looks from cars driving by and were entertained for a bit. Shortly after that this new balloon met it's demise smacking into a tree and getting popped. Oh well, mission success.
A few years later
I happened across this news article
. The balloon that got away had apparently blown a town over and caused a big UFO panic. People were calling 911, the police, and local radio stations about it. Our boredom unintentionally created a UFO panic in central NJ. I moved out of the area but when I get together with my friend we always bring this up and have a good laugh.
EDIT: Wow didn't really think this would gain much traction. Also didn't expect any NJ Redditors to have seen this let alone the author of the article to show up. Glad everyone thinks this is funny but that being said please don't go out and do this on purpose.

I put in my two weeks, said my goodbyes, and thought I was done. A couple weeks later I check my account, and there’s a paycheck sitting there like I was still working. At first I figured maybe it was for leftover hours or something. But then another check hit. And another. This went on for like 4 months straight. I’d be sitting at home watching Netflix, and boom. Direct deposit like I’d just worked two full 40 hour weeks. I kept expecting HR to call me or send a letter, but… nothing. I didn’t go crazy spending it because I was paranoid they’d want it back, but I definitely used it for rent and groceries. Then one day the money just stopped showing up, and I never heard a word. It’s been years now, and I still wonder if they ever realized or if some payroll system just kept me on autopilot until someone noticed.",

To gain more freedom I worked hard to start my career as a 3D artist, and I was making a couple hundred every few weeks at best during most of high school.
Even with how little I made compared to how hard I worked; my mom and stepdad would pressure me to chip in for the groceries and mortgage payments. Keep in mind, we aren't poor or anything, we were middle class, and they just wanted more financial freedom for themselves so they can consistently go on luxury vacations.
I also have a few siblings (now in the higher years of high school) who they also do the bare minimum for, not bad enough to where it's child neglect but definitely not great parenting considering none of us could focus on our studies while having to work.
The creative industry is difficult and unforgiving, and I put blood sweat and tears into my work to get where I am at this age. I'm not going to let them pressure me into making any big contributions to their finances so that they can keep going on excessive vacationing sprees.
Only me and my girlfriend know how much I really make. I have been saving tens of thousands of dollars without anyone else around me knowing. One day they'll find out how much I have, but for now I will bide my time and take advantage of as little financial burden as possible. Once they do, I'll simply move out and be done with them.
EDIT: Thanks a lot for the advice and comments everyone! Just to clarify, I do of course take care of my own expenses and my siblings' (since I wouldn't want them to be overburdened like I was) - I am not pitching into the household bills because they don't deserve it.

tone down their luxurious lifestyle

I knew I needed to do it at school when there were cameras and witnesses and no one could accuse my parents of anything sinister, so I waited for a day when I knew one of my teachers would let me leave mid-class to go to a different floor.

Since I started High School, my parents stopped checking in on my grades and their mentality was basically ""we don't care as long as you get into a good university"" and they've carried on this mentality to when I got into college and they didn't really checked on my grades and gave me free rein as long as I majored in the subjected they wanted and graduated on time with good grades. Well basically what happened was that I failed my first year and had to switch my major. I didn't tell them and they didn't ask so I thought as long as I got my shit together and not drop out I'll be fine. One day out of the blue last semester my dad asked me to write up a resume. I panicked and wrote up a resume but changed the GPA and major and made up some shit and thought I saved myself. Welp, this winter break my dad dropped it on me and told me he knows people in a big company, he gave them my resume and everything and wanted me to intern there. So I am fucked. They'll probably figure it out and let my dad know and I'll probably get disowned or something, and best case scenario they don't check and give me the job, and I have to live with the guilt that I got a job that I didn't deserve cause of nepotism, this shit is depressing as fuck and I'm typically an easy going guy but this whole ordeal is giving me anxiety like nothing else.

confession,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/atmizg/i_snooped_on_the_ceos_email_account_and_got/,17029,420,I snooped on the CEO's email account and got myself unfired,"A couple years out of college I worked as an analyst at a pretty small private equity firm. The CEO was one of the biggest assholes I've ever met. He was fairly young in his 40s, a multi millionare, and the type of guy driven solely by money with 0 business ethics. He'd do anything to get the upper hand in a deal regardless of who it screws over...contractors, employees...I even saw him seriously fuck over a long time family friend of his without any remorse.
Anyway, aside from my analyst role, as it was a really small business (only about 20 people in the office, and then a bunch of people working remote), I also happened to be one of the only semi technology-literate people in the company. So like many of my generation, I became the defacto ""Millenial Office Computer Guy"" too. Despite my lack of qualifications I got put in charge of handling pretty much anything minor tech related. Setting up servers....fixing laptop issues...answering ""How do I convert this to PDF"" questions...even basic network security. They thought I was some sort of computer genius...but really I was just mostly winging it, Googling pretty much everything.
But eventually I got legitimately pretty good at all the tech stuff. They gave me bigger tasks like planning all of the computer systems for their owned businesses, and supervising installs. I didn't get paid extra for any of this mind you.
After a couple years of serious bullshit working there, I was pretty worn out. I wasn't progressing. I hated working for captain douchebag...he treated everyone like shit. I was pulling 12-14+ hour days with no overtime or performance bonus. And they weren't paying me nearly what they should have. I also hated being ""the tech guy"" and was depressed as fuck basically living in a cubicle. So I decided I full on had enough of the 9-8 life working for assholes....and I would start my own consulting business working for myself.
However, instead of quitting right away, I figured it would be smart to first build up my client base on the side while I was still getting a steady paycheck. So thats what I did. I launched my company, and landed my first clients.
As the workload increased, I slowly started spending more and more time working on my side business while at my office job. At first I was pretty low key about it. But eventually, it was blatant. As it was a super small company....I was the only one who knew how to do a lot of important tasks and operate some key internal systems. It was easy for me to tell my boss a project was taking a whole week to complete, that I actually finished in 10 minutes.
Pretty soon I was spending 80% of my day working on my own stuff in the office. I'd even take calls for my side business clients at my desk. The rest of the time I was usually dicking around on Reddit or something. Of course, we had systems in place to monitor network activity. But I was the person in charge of monitoring it.
This continued for a while. As my own business ramped up, I cared less and less about the office job. And since I hated waking up early, I began rolling into work late. At first it was only 30 minutes or so. Then it progressed to an hour. When my boss didn't reprimand me...it became clear how much they needed me there. I took full advantage of this. Before long I was arriving around Noon, working for a couple hours, then heading home.
My coworkers werent happy, but I helped them with all of their tech problems and they hated the company too, so they kept their mouths shut about it. My boss eventually said something to me about all it at one point, but I just came in on time the next few days and then went back to coming in whenever I wanted.
After more than 2 months of coming in 4-5 hours late, and working on my side business in full view of my asshole boss, I couldn't believe I wasn't fired yet. I deserved it and felt it was inevitable.
On a hunch, I decided to do a little investigative work. As I was the ""tech guy"", I also had full access to the company email server. So I logged into the CEO's personal email account, and searched for my name. Lo and behold, there was a recent email thread between him, my direct boss, and some other team members with my name in the subject line. Obviously I open it. They're discussing my recent performance issues...the last email in the chain basically said ""If nobody has any objections, I will be terminating him at the end of the week"". 2 days from then.
I wasn't surprised, but I decided there was no way I was going to let these assholes fire me. Although I didn't give a shit about that job, I didn't want to have a termination in my work history. I also wanted to keep getting paid for a while longer. Of course, I couldn't let him know I actually knew I was getting canned. So, I formulated a plan to perform a little inception reverse-psychology mind fuck on the CEO.
The next day, one day before they planned to fire me, I requested a meeting with him to ""discuss my current performance."". In that meeting I sat down, and he asked me what I wanted to talk about. So I told him (paraphrased): ""Look, I know I've been a shitty employee lately. I'm sure you've noticed. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've been kind of getting the feeling you guys are planning to let me go soon."" When I said that the shocked look on his face was priceless...he must have thought I was psychic to work that out on my own the day before it was going to happen. I remember him just saying something like “uhh"". I continued while he sat flabbergasted. ""So I'll be honest with you, My heart isn't in this job anymore. As you know, I'm an entrepreneur at heart...which I’m sure you can relate to. I want to start my own company. However, as you're aware, I have a lot of responsibilities here nobody else can do."" I then proceeded to list all of the things I did and projects I was working on. I could see it on his face when the realization sunk in of how screwed he'd be if I left suddenly.
""So here's what I propose. You don't fire me. I don't quit. I keep working here for a month, finish my current projects, and train whoever you want on everything I'm in charge of. After a month is up, I will continue to come in once per week until its complete. After that, if you still need me...you can pay me on an hourly project-by-project basis"".
I intentionally mentioned the possibility of me quitting so he could feel like he ""won"" the negotiation, even though I technically had him by the balls.
He paused to think for a minute, then said something along the lines of: ""Okay. You have a deal"".
So, not only did I get myself unfired...I actually turned the company into a paying client. During that month, I continued doing pretty much whatever I wanted since I had an expiration date (while training my replacement as promised). After the month was up they hit me up regularly for remote task work . I charged them triple what I was earning while working there, and barely had to deal with the CEO.  my client base was big enough I dropped them for good.
...after all that, the CEO still calls me up for advice/questions nearly 3 years later. These days I just blow him off saying ""Sorry, I'm too busy"".
Edit:
As it seems there’s some doubt that this actually happened (it did), figured I’d clarify a few points.
1) This was a very small company. The office had about 20 people in it, and several dozen more worked remote. If you’ve never worked in a small office before, I can assure you it’s pretty normal for employees to wear many hats and take on random roles outside their initial scope. It’s also pretty normal for them to be severely lacking with network security and controlling passwords.
2) I did not become some “computer genius” and never claimed to be (tho my company of technology illiterate baby boomers sometimes thought of me that way). I had decent basic working knowledge coming into the job, and picked up more over the several years I was there. For anything complicated (like wiring, hardware installs, advanced networking tasks etc) we hired outside IT consultants. But I was the guy who would source them, hire them, supervise them and learn the systems they put in place. And I just handled more basic tasks myself . We’re also not talking about enterprise level security here either
3) my consulting business has nothing to do with private equity. Im not going to reveal exactly what I do for privacy sake since this blew up, but it’s in marketing. I didn’t steal any of my old company’s clients when I left and don’t compete with them**
4) yes, Im fully aware and admit I was an asshole, hence posting this in
/r/confession
. In fact I decided to start my own company because I hate working for other people without my own skin in the game. I’m not a great employee when I don’t care about what I’m doing. However, the guys running the company were pretty shitty people, and I did not feel that bad about it at the time.
The thing I did have reservations about was snooping on the emails. I do not condoned invading privacy like that. However, he’d freely given me the passwords (so I could help him set up his outlook, forwarding, etc), and I felt me getting fired was inevitably coming soon.",

So I kept it, I thought the woman had left the store so I went to go purchase my cards, right as I gave my money to the cashier, she walks up behind me watching me buy my 100 dollars worth of Yu-GI-Oh cards (this isn't a normal thing to do). She said nothing though and I left before she went to go buy her items so I didn't have to see the look on her face when she realized.

We separated (but never officially divorced) in 2020. I truly loved living alone with my pets, but am admittedly not the best housekeeper. Laundry is always piled up and the dishes don’t get washed until I can actually fill the dishwasher. I don’t sweep/mop as often as I should, but will make a generous effort if expecting company.
So back in 2022 we reconnected and rekindled our relationship, and decided to move back in together. His OCD (which I have recently learned to call it) is extremely frustrating. He MUST wash or sanitize his hands after touching anything that’s been on the floor, money, his wallet, etc. I am required to do the same. Any piece of clothing that has been worn outside of the bedroom (ie. his “safe space”) even if only for an hour, has to go immediately into the laundry.
He hasn’t had a legit job in over a year. Some under-the-table work for a while, started two different server jobs and was fired within a few weeks. I work full time and pay at least 90% of the bills (this was still the case before we split). So for the past year I decided that if he is gonna be a SAHH I’m not going to do the housework.
Guys, our house is disgraceful and I’d be mortified if anyone came to visit. The floors haven’t been cleaned in months. The garbage is overflowing before it gets taken out.

It's a nice small thing you can do to make someone's day and and it's a nice way to get to know how someone likes things doing. So, my morning tea used to be any old teabag (Yorkshire tea if it was on offer), a splash of milk, and the first cup always had a teaspoon of sugar; every cup after was just tea and milk. My ex however had to have a very specific ritual: Thompsons Punjana tea, a teaspoon of milk and absolutely no sugar. He was adamant that he could tell in a heartbeat when his morning cup of tea and at the age of 33, he's never liked any other tea other than Fortnum & Mason's Royal Blend.
So, in the beginning when he would stay at mine, I entertained this notion and used to make his morning tea the way he liked: Thompsons Punjana tea, a teaspoon of milk and absolutely no sugar. He would always thank me and tell me that I make the best cups of tea and it was nice, three times a week didn't kill me and it was a sweet gesture. Fast forward three months when he would spend nearly everyday of the week at mine (but not moved in), he was very demanding of his morning ritual and being a student, I couldn't keep affording to buy that brand of tea; besides, what was wrong with PG tips or any non-branded supermarket tea? Tea is tea after all. So, I used to always make his cup of tea with any tea bag, a teaspoon of milk and no sugar. I was always sure to only make it when he was in the shower or still in bed so he could never catch me out and initially, he was dubious and was always asking to make sure it was Thompsons Punjana tea (he used to call it by it's full name to emphasise how good it was). after a few trials of different teas, I finally found that sweet point where he couldn't taste the difference. I would drink it with him and as he sipped, would go on about how you can taste the quality and that there is really no other tea like it.
When we moved in with each other, it was a lot harder to disguise the fact that I was keeping the same box of tea and just filling it with regular tea bags so I had to be a bit more clever. At the time, I was studying at college so I was in control of weekly food shops and only really wanted to go twice a week to minimise costs so we had more to spend on meals out. I used to buy one bag of his tea and two bags of mine a week and kept them in the drinks cupboard. When it came to making his in the morning, I would take one of his teabags and put it in my pocket, giving him one of mine instead and I used to give my tutors at college his tea to drink during the day. He would always comment that I run out quicker of my tea bags because of the quality and that with Punjana, one bag is enough for a considerable amount of time; little did he know. This went on for a couple of years and I never told anyone about it out of fear that he would find out, as after all, he really couldn't tell so why ruin the fun? It was saving me money and it was sort of amusing. I never let him make a cup of tea unless I was away so he never really had to find out.
After we split up, we remained good friends and I've spent some time with him too in our old flat. Every time I visit, he always asks me to make a cup of tea the way I used to for old times sake because everyone he's been with or dated after me can never ""make it taste the way I did"". He even says that when he makes it himself with Punjana that he could never make it taste right and that I was some sort of special tea maker. I still haven't told him.
This is a long post about tea so the TLDR: ex used to play on that he was very fussy with tea, I switched his morning cup to a considerably cheaper tea bag and he could never tell the difference and still can't.",
confession,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1nhl84h/i_edited_a_yearbook_entry_and_never_told_anyone/,15235,317,I edited a yearbook entry and never told anyone about it,"this happened during my last year of high school, and I’ve never told anyone about it. I was part of the yearbook committee and we had this tradition where seniors would write short texts about each graduating student. Most of them were sweet or funny, but I noticed one entry that really bothered me: there was this guy in our year who wasn’t part of the popular crowd and had been bullied throughout high school. Yes he was a bit weird, but he was never mean. Someone had written what looked like a nice tribute to him on the surface, but it was full of cruel undertones. They made subtle digs about his crush, mocked his outfits/style, and included other meanspirited jokes that only made sense if you knew the context of how he’d been treated. The submission was anonymous, but I could tell from the email address it came from one kid that always tried to make jokes to be popular. It just felt so cruel to me. Like a final last kick while he was down before graduation. So.. I changed it. I didn’t rewrite the whole thing, just edited out the mean parts and made it neutral and kind. I was careful not to make it overly glowing since that would have seemed suspicious, but I made sure there was nothing hurtful hidden in there. When the yearbooks came out, no one questioned the text, and as far as I know, the guy never knew how close he came to being publicly humiliated one last time. I never told him what I did and I never told anyone else on the committee. honestly, I’m not sorry about what I did even though I wasn’t allowed to change the submissions. Everyone deserves to have their high school years end on a decent note. I still think about it sometimes and wonder how he’s doing now
Edit: Maybe to clarify something: I know this is not a horrible confession, but I felt the need to share it with someone. I know I officially did something against the school rules, which was not legally right, but like I said I don’t feel bad about that. I wanted to share this here because, honestly it’s easier to tell strangers on the internet than people I actually know. It happened over a decade ago, and bringing it up in real life would just be awkward for me to the people I know today. Like “Hey, there was a kid at my school you’ve never heard of. Well, here’s this thing I did back then.” Plus I didn’t keep in touch with anyone from those days. I was one of those shy kiddos who liked to fly under the radar. I’m expecting my first kid and that has especially got me thinking a lot about how kids treat each other. I already knew back then that it was wrong how this guy was treated, because it wasn’t his fault to be different from others. He was quite nice, just socially pretty awkward and didn’t fit into the group dynamics of our year. I’m not proud of never saying something in person and only having the guts to do something when I could hide myself in a group and then escape to college
Edit2: and thanks for all the kind words and awards! I’m happy I decided to share this story. The comments have been interesting to read. So many of you opened up about your own rough times at school and it’s kind of sad how many people have these memories.",

Edit: this was 3 or 4 years ago and I’m currently in an amazing relationship with a very kind man. Thanks for all the support so far guys it means a lot. I’ve come a long way but man, those days were rough. I do feel a tinge guilty about how I reacted, so I appreciate you guys here giving nothing but love.
Edit 2: Wow was not expecting this to blow up. For those of you saying I need help, trust me I get that. I was in a very dark place at the time. And I was VERY drunk while doing all of this. I ended up going to rehab and am happily sober now. My life has IMMENSELY changed for the better and I handle things way better now!
Edit 3: For those of you wondering why I “let the ex off easy”- honestly I should have guessed he wasn’t that into me. I just wanted him bad and deep down knew he was using me for a place to stay/food/my car/etc. I got myself into that situation. It was a really rough time and I had literally 0 self respect. What really broke my heart was my best friend betraying me like that. I did kick the ex out and he was homeless/without a car/etc so he didn’t get off easy that’s for sure. But at the same time the pain from him cheating was absolutely nothing compared to the realization that I lost my best friend.
Edit 4: also I realize my title was very confusing and long winded lol. For those confused, I’m a female. My roommate was a confident gay male. I didn’t know the guy I was dating was in to dudes
Edit 5: I apologized to my old roommate and vice versa. We are both in better places and good friends again. I forgave him and he forgave me, this charade was years ago and we have moved past it
Okay last edit: To whoever gave me gold, that’s so sweet I honestly did not expect this reaction. It’s my birthday today and I’ve had a great time reading all these comments so thanks Reddit. You guys rock",

Probably the only place I will ever say this","Not using a throw away because I hate myself I guess. Last night my friend and I went to a concert an hour away. We got there early and decided to get something to eat. We shared some spicy Korean fried chicken and a panini.
We get to the concert, and about an hour in… I thought the smell (a straight up sausage and bell peppers smell) was my friend burping or something?? a little while later, the smell comes again. I’m confused. we were talking, she didn’t burp, so I’m like, ok someone else around is probably burping or literally eating bell peppers LMAO. The smell was so random and brief, but so consuming. Time passes, the smell appears once more, she says something along the lines of “I keep smelling bell peppers” and I’m like “oh my god me too???” We had a laugh when we were able to finally hear one another leaving the theater, and head home. All is well. 
Writing this now, the day after. The smell was me. I just farted, and yea. I was shocked lmao. Spicy food can upset my stomach sometimes, and tbh I don’t think I even fully noticed I was slipping out farts at the function because I was so overwhelmed, and when I did discreetly let one out I did not imagine it was that smell somehow?? 😭
So yea. Went to a concert, goofed on the potential gassy queen. I was the gassy queen all along.
EDIT: to clarify, since you guys wanna be mean lmao
I didn’t explain what I meant well. I do not have a “loose butthole” 😌
I was not thinking clearly bc I was overstimulated. when I tell you I truly was sooooo sure it could not be me producing the smell bc it didn’t even smell like a fart. my brain was just dissociated so I wasn’t putting 2 and 2 together that the smell was me, which sounds dumb, I’m aware, but it’s what happened lmao. I knew I was farting, it was just an afterthought. Do you really remember every time you fart?
I know bell peppers aren’t spicy, I never said they were. I said the fried chicken I ate was. I didn’t even eat bell peppers. I have no idea how my fart smelled like that
The smarty farties who are being bummers in the communal fart chat, I hope you go to fart and it’s poop.
I love everyone commenting their fart stories, yall are so cool 🫶🏼 it feels like in whoville when all the whos come together and eat who hash and roast beast 👯‍♀️👯‍♀️👯‍♀️ except we’re all crop dusting",

confession,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/muh0j4/i_lied_to_a_blind_neighbor_and_told_him_i_moved/,14754,388,I lied to a blind neighbor and told him I moved away,"Many years ago, I was standing on one of my balconies when a taxi driver was obnoxiously blowing his horn out front and yelling for a blind man to ""walk toward my voice"" from his own townhouse. That direction was toward traffic. My roommate and I went down and helped him to the taxi and scolded the driver for being so rude. I made the mistake of giving the blind neighbor my phone number so that I could give him a ride in the future.
Then the phone calls came... and never stopped. And when I gave him a ride, he would ask for various detours. I'm very calculated by nature, if he had told me beforehand where he wanted to go, it would be cool, but no... we'd be driving along and he'd throw in 2 - 3 extra places on each ride. And it came to be every day that he wanted rides... and he'd even call me to remind me to give him a ride, not that was ever late or backed out.
Finally I had enough, so I gauged how blind he was. His response was that he was ""blind as a bat"". A week or two after he said that, I told him I had a job interview in the next city. A week after that, I told him I got the job and was moving away in a month. After I ""moved away"" It was strange as hell walking by him in silence as he stood on the sidewalk.",
confession,https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1p3yfzl/my_boss_paid_me_to_be_a_pretty_face_in_client/,14730,713,My boss paid me to be a pretty face in client meetings,"I got a job as software developer for a company that supports realtors and real estate companies in 2016.
A year into the job, I receive a meeting invite on my calendar from someone who I recognized as a VP in my company. I didn't know any of the other attendees, but I show up to the meeting. I take a seat in the corner of a large table. As I'm sitting there, a message pops up on Teams from the VP saying, ""I'm gonna talk about
such and such
, and when I call on you, I want to you say
this and that
."" I did exactly what I was told. Afterward the meeting, the VP pulls me aside and says, ""you did great!""
I started getting more invites like this. About once a month, I sit in on some meeting to listen to my execs talk about business contracts with our clients and customers. Sometimes I showed a demo of our software, but most of the time I just didn't say anything. I took some notes that no one ever looked at or asked to see.
I was at the lowest level of the totem poll. I have no reason to be at these meetings. The bigwig at my company told me that he just ""wants me to be aware of the business"". Whatever that means.
A few times, my company flew me to Dallas, New York, Orlando, and elsewhere to quietly sit in some meeting. Once, I got to eat dinner at a fancy restaurant in San Francisco with all these strangers who had more money than god as they talked about golf and business contracts.
One time, a client starts talking to me about some real-estate thing I had no understand about. He asks what I do for the company. The VP answers on my behalf before I can even get the words out: ""This is [name], she's our lead technology strategist. She ensures our business priorities align with our tech."" The client accepted that at face value. I smile and nod along with the VP's brazenly confident bullshittery.
I was now certain of the true unspoken reason for my presence: they liked having my pretty face and soft-spoken voice in those meeting. I'm a smiley, upbeat, bubbly, and extroverted person in real life. Maybe they thought my feminine wiles would disarm and pacify our business partners into a more agreeable business deal.
I understood my role in these meetings. Despite that, no one ever made a comment on my physical appearance or attractiveness. I was never sexually harassed on the job. They treated me with absolute professionalism.
In 2021, my employer was acquired by a bigger fish in the real estate market. My office was made redundant. I moved on to greener pastures.
I am still a computer programmer. But maybe I should have gone into sales instead.",

They were there, specifically, to observe me.","I’ll never forgot the time two grown women were introduced to our class as 'observers' for the week—“they’ll be in the back watching me teach for a few days. In order for them to do their job properly, please ignore them! Act like they’re not here.”  They sat silently in the back taking notes on their respective clipboards for an hour or so each day. On that Friday, my teacher keeps me back during recess, telling me the two women want to chat/ask me some questions. I was then placed in a chair directly facing them, with my teacher and her aide standing off to the side a few steps behind the duo.
Something was up.
They then proceed to tell me, delicately, why they’re here. They go on to explain that my teacher knows I’m a good student and so my recent failing test grades don't make sense. They then show examples of me spelling the same words, or doing the same math accurately on previous tests/assignments, yet completely wrong with recent ones. “Have you been failing these tests on purpose?”  This was the first time I experienced that heart-beating-out-of-my-chest type feeling. For one, it was TRUE, I was faking it. On top of that, they seemed VERY serious, scary serious, especially to my 8yo self. I, shamefully, admitted that yes, I had been. And when they asked
why
— well, that answer (the truth) led to my first (non-parental) authoritative-scolding on memory.
Simply, I did it because I was jealous of the kids who
seemingly
got to have a second recess  There was group of 20 or so students across the six 2nd grade classrooms who got pulled each week for roughly half the day. One day I saw them playing outside from inside the classroom. They appeared to be having soo much fun, and I wanted in on the fun. So I asked one of them how they got put into that group and was told, “because I’m bad at spelling and math”.
Ugh, my two strongest subjects. What am I ever to do?
Dumb myself down, of course! To become one of them, I had to act like them, think like them, test like them.
After our lil’ interview sesh, my failed attempt at manipulation - whatever you wanna call it - was never discussed of again. My parents never questioned me about it (to this day I don’t know what they know/were told, if anything at all), my peers never knew about it, and I never told a soul. Those women scared the living daylights out of me.",
