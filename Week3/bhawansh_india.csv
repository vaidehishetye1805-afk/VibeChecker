india,https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f9outu/fuck_all_religion/,19492,4101,Fuck all Religion,"Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova.
You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe.
But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation.
False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.
Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.
A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age.
Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

The whole argument from their side is BS.
They finally accepted that Wolf Gupta is imaginary. Why didn't they accept this earlier?
Check the document, and see for yourself all their hollow claims. The link at the end.
I am looking for lawyers. Got a lot of numbers. Talking to them right now.
One good lawyer suggested I back out, sign an apology and end it, said will cost you 30k rupees only, and that's it.
I won't back out. (Although my parents still don't know what mess I have indulged myself into. But I feel I will be able to handle them.)
Why did WhiteHatJr take this risky step? Like it seems like it won't go in their favor in public. Yet they took this desperate step. Because they know what I know and they want me to stop sharing it out there in public. Their lawsuit is to get interim junction and make me stop showing it to everyone. And even try to take down all my videos/posts/Reddit everything.
In the past 9 days, I tried if some big publication would write about it. But no one did. (Apart from one, Thanks to
Morning Context
and Ashish K Mishra for the article).
So what is it that they are trying to bury so hard?
This spreadsheet, the LIST of all the videos/tweets/links/posts/LinkedIn/Facebook/IG/ quora/Reddit/(9gag also) they reported and took down. The list contains over 700 such links. (If I included the comments of the parents that they were removing, the list would be over 2k)
Here is the List: Download, find these people, and tell them what happened to their posts. If your content was also taken down find it here: 
<As per court orders I have removed the link>
There is more. The whole company reeks of lies and deceit. Once I said I will find out who Wolf Gupta and who all these fictitious kids are. Now that the media is silent, here is the birth story of such kids and their 'apps'. And you tell me if I was wrong when I called this company a FRAUD.
<removed after Delhi HC orders on 24/11/2020 >
Neither the kids existed, nor the apps. And they really created a $300 million company around it.
If that is now fraud what it? Now I think now you can understand why the threats, why this case, why they are talking so much risk but not looking at their own mistakes. This proof was shared with one journalist but they ignored it. Now you can understand why the media was silent.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now, what do I do here?
I have three options.
Back out. Apologize and move on. Which I won't.
Hire a normal lawyer on my own and they would drag this case and make me exhausted.
As seen in many tweets today, many of you asked me to start a fund and where all can chip in and hire the best lawyer possible.
Please write in the comments which option should be taken. If option #3, please quote how much can you contribute for real, also suggest to me how to start a fundraiser and what platforms are good for it. WhiteHatJr has already spent 25 lakhs on preparing this case. So legal fights are costly. I alone can only go to a point until my pockets are empty.
Thanks

Some requests:
PLEASE don't suggest me to contact Xyz, it takes time. Each email needs to be written accordingly. I would REALLY appreciate if you write emails to different journalist/YouTubers on my behalf. I am already running out of time. A lot has to be in the next few hours.
Some one please cross-post this in different subreddutts.
WRITE about this issue. Let's not wait for the media. I have posted most of the proofs on youtube and my Twitter. Please write blogs etc about this. Can someone also try to post this issue on LinkedIn, I am banned from there.
Share etc do all that. You see how to spread this news now. Make a small poster kind of thing, those seem to work better than such long texts.
I might not be able to reply to comments and DMs today, please don't mind.
Thanks again
Pradeep Poonia.

india,https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nboonh/what_is_actually_happening_in_nepal/,11477,650,What is Actually Happening in Nepal ?? Misinformation by Indian Media.,"Hello to my fellow neighbors in India.
I am a
Nepali citizen
living near the border, connected to both our countries not only geographically but also culturally. That is why I feel it is my duty to share the truth with you about what is really happening here.
You may have seen headlines claiming that Nepal is facing
“mass protests led by Gen Z against social media ban.”
That is only a half-truth.
Here is the real sequence of events:
Three days ago, the Nepal government suddenly banned 26 social media platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, and Reddit.
They claimed it was about registration and taxes. But these companies are already registered and paying taxes. The real motive is censorship: giving the government power to control online information, delete posts critical of them within 24 hours, and jail those who speak up.
In the next two days, criticism exploded across the country. A date was set—September 8—for nationwide protests. But it was never just about social media. That ban was only the spark.
Our patience had already run out.
Soon, the “
Nepo Babies
” trend erupted in Nepal. It exposed the lavish lifestyles of politicians’ children—designer (clothes,bags, watches, attire )worth lakhs, luxury cars, million-rupee homes, weekly international flights, and even private jets—while ordinary Nepalis struggle daily for survival. Our PM has a salary less than 65k INR but what is owns is in million of $$$.
This hit a nerve.
 Because Nepal has been under one form of tyranny or another for decades. From monarchy to so-called democracy, corruption and instability have never left us. Not a single prime minister has completed a full term in over 20 years.
[The protests were organized in the name of Gen Z, but they welcomed everyone. We were not just protesting a social media ban. We were standing against corruption, nepotism, tyranny, suppression, and decades of betrayal. In a country of just 30 million people, every single day around 5,000 youths leave to work abroad because there are no jobs, no decent pay, and no basic livelihood at home.]
And then the tragedy struck. Today, during the protest, I witnessed & carried something I will never forget. A 15-year-old schoolboy, still in uniform, was shot in the head by security forces—acting on orders from a minister. He was not the only one. Reports say more than 20 people have been killed, thousands injured, and the true numbers are being hidden.
I came home with blood still on my hands, only to see Indian news channels spinning a completely false narrative. They claimed it was all about social media and mocked our youths as being “
addicted
” to it. That angered me, but it didn’t surprise me. I know how the media can twist things.
That is why I am writing this here, to let you know the truth from the ground.

I suspected these to be gunshots as, well you know. I messaged my group chat about it and they said they heard the same things. Some guy said **** Market (a very populous place where I go, like, on a daily basis) was destroyed. Even rn I dont know if he was lying or not, but who knows. I ran upstairs and told my family about all this and we went up to the roof to see what was happening. Oh man, I have never felt anything like I felt then. Whole ass missiles were flying. We quickly turned off all the lights and went to my room, where we are still sitting. Light had gone for a long time and we were constantly looking at news on my pc. And turns out I was lucky. Although I live in one of the most major parts of Jammu, there was not much damage here. According to the Descriptions of my other friends' situations in the group chat, they supposedly had it a lot worse. Right around 9 PM, light came back and most of the people in my neighborhood have turned on their lights (I find that to be dumb). These have the longest hours of my life, and im just telling u half of the story. Much more happened in my house but its kinda personal so I cant say here. Anyways im still very worried because this is definitely not the end of the war or worse, there can be more attacks even tonight. They struck army airport, hospital, which was thankfully intercepted by the Indian Airforce. so they clearly have a very bad plan in their mind (Pakistan). Anyways I wish yall peace.

When I found fake accounts manipulating Indian politics, FB approved their removal - until they discovered that some of them were being ran by a sitting MP. The Lok Sabha is considering asking me to testify, but Reddit gets to go first. Ask me anything.","Hi,
r/india
I'm Sophie Zhang. At Facebook, I worked in my spare time at Facebook to stop major political figures/parties and world governments from using the platform to deceive their own citizenry - a deeply exhausting task that I've compared to trying to empty the ocean with a colander. When I was fired in September 2020, I stayed up until 8am in the morning to write a 7,800 word internal memo that was
leaked to the press against my objections.
I testified privately
to the INGE committee of the European Parliament in October 2020 even though I was refusing all public appearances, because they asked and my duty to democracy came first. I
went public with the Guardian
in April of this year because the problems of social media will never be solved unless directly confronted. Three weeks ago, I
testified before the British Parliament.
​
I worked across dozens of countries to protect civic discourse - ranging from Argentina to Albania, from India to Iraq, and more. The most pressing of my discoveries occurred when I personally caught the national governments of
Honduras
and
Azerbaijan
using fake assets to exploit and mislead their own citizenry on massive scales. I was also deeply concerned with Albania, where
an apparent state-sponsored network associated with the ruling Socialist Party
was similarly misleading Albanian citizens, but was unable to resolve the investigation before my departure.
In India during late 2019 and early 2020, I found an eventual total of five separate networks of fake accounts across the political spectrum supporting the INC (2), AAP (1), and BJP (2.) The pro-AAP network was acting to manipulate discourse in the Delhi 2020 elections, a fact that was very concerning to myself. Although Delhi is a local state of India, it has a population comparable to small countries such as Taiwan (fortunately I live in the U.S. and aren't in danger from saying this.) I was able to have four out of the five networks taken down (2 pro-INC network, 1 pro-AAP, and 1 pro-BJP.) FB employees approved the takedown of the fifth network, one supporting the BJP, but everything suddenly went silent
after we discovered they were connected to the account of the benefiting MP (meaning that someone with access to the MP's personal account was almost certainly running the fake accounts.)
​
My disclosures of these events have led to
considerable
recent
interest in India
, including
a call by the Internet Freedom Foundation
for myself and Frances Haugen to testify before the Lok Sabha. I arranged this AMA when I was being impatient and took the silence from the Lok Sabha to indicate that they were uninterested in calling me to testify. Since then, MP Shashi Tharoor, the Chairman of the Standing Committee on IT, has
publicly announced
that the committee is seeking approval from the Speaker to allow my testimony.
​
Separate from this,
I have also written an article on autolikers
, which are common in the Global South (including India.) Many Indians sign up for what appear to be free likes, not realizing that by doing so they have given over their credentials to shady middlemen where they may eventually be sold to e.g. an IT cell.
​
Because it often results in confusion, I want to be clear that I worked on fake accounts and inauthentic behavior - an issue that is separate from misinformation/fake news/etc. Misinformation depends solely on your words; if you write ""Cats and dogs are the same species"", it doesn't matter who you are: it's still misinformation. In contrast, inauthenticity depends solely on the user; if I dispatch 1000 fake accounts onto Reddit to comment ""Cats are adorable"", the words don't matter - it's still inauthentic behavior. If Reddit takes the fake accounts down, they're correct to do so no matter how much I yell ""they're censoring cute cats!""
​
There are genuine questions regarding how to respond to misinformation and hate speech while protecting freedom of speech. But no one serious defends the right of a politician to set up a network of inauthentic accounts supporting himself. Stopping this is necessary to protect freedom of speech, not a violation of those principles - just as stopping ballot stuffing is necessary to protect the sanctity of the ballot and the right to vote.
​
If you're interested in other things I've done, I've also written
a guide to whistleblowing
, and an op-ed arguing that the
United States is too worried about Russian social media interference
. If you have personal questions about my life,
there's a profile of me in MIT Technology Review.
​
Please ask me anything.  I might not be able to answer every question, but if so, I'll do my best to explain why I can't.
